a frog in india(GPE) has a mushroom sprouting out of it . researchers have never seen anything like it 

by taylor(PERSON) nicioli(PERSON) , cnn(ORG) 

( cnn(ORG) ) — when observing a hoard of golden - backed frogs at a roadside pond in karnataka(GPE) , india(GPE) , a group of naturalists noticed something odd about one of the amphibians — the animal had a tiny mushroom sprouting out of its side . 

how the seemingly healthy frog came to grow its fungi companion — an occurrence that ’s never been documented before — has left scientists baffled , according to a note published in january(DATE) in the journal reptiles and amphibians(NORP) . 

“ when i first(ORDINAL) observed the frog with the mushroom , i was amazed and intrigued by the sight , ” said lohit y t , a rivers and wetlands specialist with world wildlife fund - india in bengaluru(GPE) , via email . y t was a part of the group that discovered the frog . “ my thought was to document it , as this phenomenon is something we have never heard of . we just wanted this to be a rare incident and not a dangerous phenomenon for the frog . ” 

the species — known as rao(ORG) ’s intermediate golden - backed frog , or the scientific name hylarana(PERSON) intermedia(PERSON) — is found in abundance in the southwestern indian states of karnataka(GPE) and kerala(GPE) . the frogs are small , growing to be only up to 2.9(QUANTITY) inches(QUANTITY) ( 7.4(QUANTITY) centimeters(QUANTITY) ) in length . 

as the naturalists watched the frog with the fungal growth , the animal moved from the center of the twig it sat upon to the very tip , turning around and changing positions , but the mushroom remained perfectly in place , y t said . the group did not touch the frog . 

the authors discovered the amphibian in june(DATE) 2023(DATE) and did not collect it , so neither the cause of the phenomenon nor the fate of the frog is known . 

but through pictures , mycologists later identified the mushroom growing out of the frog ’s flank as a common bonnet , part of the mycena genus , a type of fungi that mostly grows on rotting wood from dead trees , the authors wrote in the published paper . the fungus is a saprotrophic decomposer , a mushroom that typically gets its nutrients from dead or decaying organic matter — but a 2023(CARDINAL) study found the mushroom could evolve to thrive on living plants as well . 

the 2023(DATE) study further suggested that the mycena fungus could develop to have a symbiotic relationship with living plants or trees , meaning that both the plant and the fungus growing on it would benefit from the arrangement — the fungi would both take nutrients from and transfer them to the plant host . in trees , mycena could be helpful by pruning dead branches , the authors added . 

the prognosis of the frog with the mushroom hitchhiker is unknown , but there are a handful of theories as to the cause of its condition . 

fate of the mushroom frog 

upon first(ORDINAL) seeing the report of the frog with a mushroom attached to its flank , alyssa(PERSON) wetterau(PERSON) kaganer(PERSON) , a postdoctoral associate in the(ORG) department(ORG) of(ORG) public(ORG) and(ORG) ecosystem(ORG) health(ORG) at the(ORG) cornell(ORG) university(ORG) college(ORG) of(ORG) veterinary(ORG) medicine(ORG) , found the discovery fascinating . 

“ fungi are dynamic organisms that adapt to changes in their environment , and with exposure to new potential hosts in different environments or climates they may grow in places we had n’t previously expected , ” she said in an email . 

while it is difficult to predict the fate of the frog without further study of its condition , it is possible that “ an otherwise healthy frog may be able to withstand mild colonization of its skin by this fungus without any adverse health effects , ” kaganer said . fungal infections in frogs are very common , however , and if the mushroom were to “ grow extensively on the skin or burrow within the animal ’s body , the animal may develop signs of a fungal disease , ” she added . kaganer was not involved with the discovery . 

there are many types of fungi that can infect frogs , and it is possible there are fungus - frog interactions yet to be discovered . a frog with signs of fungal disease , such as “ altered behavior of the frog ” or “ skin damage including ulceration or tumor - like nodules , ” has an infection that can often result in death for at least some of the infected animals , kaganer said . 

anything out of the ordinary , including a fungal growth like this , is of concern for frog species , said karthikeyan(PERSON) vasudevan(PERSON) , chief scientist for the laboratory for the conservation of endangered species at the centre for cellular and molecular biology in telangana(GPE) , india(GPE) . vasudevan(PERSON) was not involved with the discovery and was also surprised by the find . 

“ sick animals in the wild have very little chance of survival . to notice a sick animal is difficult , as they die or get eaten up quickly . therefore , something like this is interesting and should be followed up with observations and screening of frogs , ” vasudevan(PERSON) said in an email . 

initially , vasudevan(PERSON) had thought the mushroom was stuck on the frog ’s skin rather than a growth , but photos of the critter convinced him otherwise . “ it is indeed the case of a live mushroom on a live frog , ” vasudevan(PERSON) said . “ but one(CARDINAL) of the possibilities is that there is a small piece of woody debris under the skin of the frog after it got lodged in the skin and it has sprouted a mushroom from it . ” 

chytrid(ORG) disease caused by fungus 

india(GPE) is currently facing an epidemic of a frog - killing disease known as chytridiomycosis , a fungal infection that affects more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 700(CARDINAL) species of amphibians worldwide . the disease has been observed in low levels in all the frog hotspots across india(GPE) , the authors of the new note wrote . 

chytrid(ORG) disease is an example of a common amphibian and fungi interaction . but the authors do not know whether it is related to this discovery , y t said . 

“ this specific type of mushroom is not closely related to the species of fungus that cause chytridiomycosis , so i am not concerned that this mushroom is a direct sign of chytridiomycosis , ” said kaganer , who studies the disease . “ however , it is possible that a frog with mycena might have altered susceptibility to a chytrid(ORG) infection . ” 

the frog with the mushroom in its side could either have an increase in susceptibility to chytridiomycosis from being compromised by the mycena , or it could be more immune “ because the mycena has kicked the frog ’s immune system into high gear , ” she added . 

“ we do n’t have any hope of pursuing the frog , as this is not a common phenomenon , ” y t said . the authors will visit the spot again during the(DATE) next(DATE) monsoon(DATE) season(DATE) , when the weather is warm and rainy and the frogs are most abundant , he added . 

“ if we manage to find it , it ’ll be great , ” y t said . “ the spot has been frequented by many enthusiasts and experts alike . it would be great if some researcher gets their hands on it and can further the investigation , but again , it ’s all highly unlikely to happen . ”

california(GPE) - mental - health - care - policy : 

california(GPE) ’s proposition 1(CARDINAL) – the only statewide measure on the ballot – would significantly restructure california(GPE) ’s mental health system . 

it is also one of the most complex and convoluted measures voters have had to decide on in recent(DATE) years(DATE) . the full text of the proposition in the state ’s 112(CARDINAL) - page voter guide takes up 68(CARDINAL) pages . 

the measure has two(CARDINAL) parts . first(ORDINAL) , it would raise $ 6.4bn(MONEY) over 20(DATE) years(DATE) to build more housing and treatment facilities for people with mental health and substance use disorders . it would also enact new requirements on how the state ’s mental health budget would be spent – redirecting about(CARDINAL) a(CARDINAL) third(CARDINAL) toward housing and rental assistance for unhoused people with serious mental illness or addiction , and another(PERCENT) 35(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) toward treatments for that population . 

california(GPE) ’s governor , gavin(PERSON) newsom(PERSON) , who proposed the measure as a crucial part of his plans to solve the state ’s dire homelessness crisis , has said it would “ prioritise getting people off the streets , out of tents and into treatment ” . opponents , including disability rights activists , mental health advocates and the(ORG) american(ORG) civil(ORG) liberties(ORG) union(ORG) , countered that it would take money away from community - based preventative mental health programs to finance locked - door psychiatric institutions and involuntary treatment . 

“ it ’s good politics , as newsom positions himself to run for president in 2028(DATE) , ” said samuel(PERSON) jain(PERSON) , a senior policy attorney for disability rights california(GPE) , an advocacy group . “ it ’s not good policy . ” 

the bond measure was not controversial until late(DATE) last(DATE) year(DATE) , when last(TIME) -(TIME) minute(TIME) amendments to the bill placing it on the ballot stripped language preventing the funds from being used on involuntary confinements . the changes came hours(TIME) before it was too late to change the legislation , said jain(PERSON) , who added : “ it came as a really big surprise . ” 

the result , jain(ORG) said , was a hefty , opaque ballot measure that lumps housing for veterans and unhoused people and treatment programs for people with severe mental illness and substance use disorders alongside funding for programs that could facilitate coerced institutionalisation . 

critics have also pointed out that the $ 6.4bn(MONEY) bond would fund only(CARDINAL) about(CARDINAL) 4,350(CARDINAL) new homes for people , according to the state legislative analyst ’s office – which is hardly enough to shelter california(GPE) ’s estimated 180,000(CARDINAL) unhoused people . 

meanwhile , the yes on prop 1(CARDINAL) campaign , backed by healthcare companies such as sutter health and kaiser permanente and unions backing the state ’s prison guards and construction workers , have amassed about(MONEY) $(MONEY) 14.3(MONEY) m(MONEY) to sell the measure , focusing on how the program would help veterans and the unhoused . the no campaign has raised just(MONEY) about(MONEY) $(MONEY) 1,000(MONEY) , according to campaign finance records . 

but taken along with other major mental health programs that newsom(ORG) and legislators have championed , advocates worry that prop 1(CARDINAL) will further efforts to institutionalise and lock away unhoused people . the governor ’s other landmark mental health reforms include the care court program , which will empower families , healthcare providers and outreach workers to ask state courts to compel people with certain severe mental disorders into treatment programs designated by local governments , and sb43(PERSON) , which expands the group of people who can be placed in involuntary psychiatric holds or forced to undergo medical treatment to include people with serious mental health and substance use disorders who are deemed unable to provide for their own personal safety or medical care . 

“ in the(DATE) 1960s(DATE) , we began the process of shutting down our psychiatric hospitals , ” newsom(ORG) said at a thursday(DATE) rally promoting the proposition . but as the state got rid of its psychiatric beds , it did not provide enough investment in community programs and care homes as alternative treatments , he continued , saying : “ is it any surprise what we ’re experiencing and those that are struggling and suffering are experiencing ? it ’s because of our neglect . ” 

building more psychiatric beds and treatment facilities may be a comfort to families who have struggled to help relatives with severe mental conditions and substance use disorders , newsom(ORG) and other supporters say . but mental health providers and researchers warn that if prop 1(CARDINAL) facilitates involuntary or coerced care , it could ultimately be counterproductive . 

“ few who review the existing evidence conclude that on balance , involuntary treatment improves the lives of those who experience it , ” said david(PERSON) cohen(PERSON) , a professor of social welfare at the(ORG) university(ORG) of(ORG) california(ORG) , los(GPE) angeles(GPE) , and a former social worker . “ it ’s literally a band - aid solution . ” 

being coerced or forced into care can traumatise people who are already contending with deep traumas , he explained . “ being deprived of freedom is maddening . being robbed of credibility is humiliating , ” he said . though hospitalization or institutionalisation are often used to keep suicidal people safe , counterintuitively , studies have found that such patients may be at heightened risk of self - harm after being discharged . 

increasing avenues for institutionalisation and building more locked - door psychiatric and behavioural health facilities could also disproportionately harm black californians(NORP) and other californians(NORP) of color , said jerel(PERSON) ezell(PERSON) , an assistant professor of community(ORG) health(ORG) sciences(ORG) at uc(ORG) berkeley(ORG) . black people , who make up about(PERCENT) 6(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) of california(GPE) ’s general population , account for 26(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) of the unhoused population . “ and black people are overdiagnosed with schizophrenia and other related conditions , ” he said . “ they ’re also more stigmatised or more criminalised . ” 

with prop 1(CARDINAL) funding , the state could expand its capacity to clear the streets of the most visibly unwell unhoused people , and funnel them to programs that could do more harm than good . “ it ’s an optics thing , ” he said . “ it looks good , to say we ’re doing something . ” but long term , much more housing and voluntary , preventive programs as well as asylum spaces for drug users are what people really need to recover , he said . 

many of the biggest opponents of prop 1(CARDINAL) are local governments and health workers who worry it will shutter local , community - based , early intervention programs , including ones that provide care for immigrant communities , communities of color and unhoused people . 

decisions about which funding would be redirected would be made by counties if the measure passed , and nobody knows how much money would be cut from which programs . proponents of prop 1(CARDINAL) argue that those early intervention programs could draw more funding from medi(GPE) -(GPE) cal(GPE) , the state ’s public health program for lower - income residents , which has recently been expanded . 

rural placer county , where supervisors voted to oppose the measure , would redirect about(MONEY) $(MONEY) 5(MONEY) m(MONEY) from existing mental health and prevention services that are already very scarce . 

“ proposition 1 is going to put more money towards building these expensive , locked psychiatric institutions . it ’s going to provide grants to for - profit hospitals to actually build those facilities , ” jain(ORG) said . “ and in turn , it ’s going to defund cost - effective mental health services in the community . ”

ph - eyes - triangular - pact - with - india - japan : 

ph eyes ‘ triangular ’ pact with india(GPE) , japan(GPE) 

the(ORG) philippine(ORG) government(ORG) is exploring the potential of a “ triangular cooperation ” with japan(GPE) and india(GPE) to strengthen the security and economic sectors for peace and stability in the indo - pacific region . 

foreign undersecretary theresa(PERSON) lazaro(PERSON) on friday(DATE) said a partnership among the three(CARDINAL) countries would not only provide collaboration in the field of security but also boost economic and development opportunities that would be “ directly felt by the people . ” 

against china(GPE) agenda 

“ the prospect for triangular cooperation between the philippines(GPE) , india(GPE) and japan(GPE) falls neatly into this narrative . this partnership can help drive the economic engines of these countries towards shared economic prosperity in the region , ” she said at a conference organized by the(ORG) stratbase(ORG) adr(ORG) institute(ORG) in makati(GPE) city(GPE) . 

geopolitical expert dr(PERSON) .(PERSON) jagannath(PERSON) panda(PERSON) pointed to the need for cooperation among the philippines(GPE) , japan(GPE) and india(GPE) to resist china(GPE) ’s “ revisionist ” agenda . 

in his keynote presentation , panda showed photos of maps that indicated china(GPE) ’s nine(CARDINAL) - dash line demarcation of its claims to nearly the entire south(LOC) china(LOC) sea(LOC) . 

he said the three(CARDINAL) countries must come together to resist china(GPE) ’s unilateral claims . 

“ the background note that will really bring this trilateral into a success is the revisionism resistance that these three(CARDINAL) countries are actually holding against china(GPE) and against the authoritarian powers , ” he said . 

freedom of navigation must be maintained , and the commercial interests of the three(CARDINAL) countries must also be protected , according to panda , referring to the naval and commercial traffic through the south(LOC) china(LOC) sea(LOC) , one(CARDINAL) of the world ’s strategic waterways where there are multiple conflicting maritime claims . 

2(CARDINAL) other pacts 

“ we not only need to preserve the status quo but we also need to resist authoritarian revisionist tendencies that china(GPE) and some of the authoritarian countries are promoting in the region , ” he said . 

according to lazaro(ORG) , the philippines(GPE) currently has two(CARDINAL) trilateral pacts , one with indonesia(GPE) and malaysia(GPE) to deal with piracy and terrorism in their common maritime borders , and another with the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) and japan(GPE) to enhance their capabilities for maintaining stability in the indo - pacific region .

“ in concrete terms , the confluence of the two(CARDINAL) seas can be construed as a natural connection that paves the way for the intersection of interests and goal congruence among the varied actors in the indo - pacific , ” lazaro(ORG) , said referring to the indian(NORP) and the(LOC) pacific(LOC) oceans(LOC) . 

‘ geopolitical logic ’ 

in an interview with reporters after the conference , the philippine(NORP) foreign affairs official said that forging a trilateral pact with japan(GPE) and india(GPE) still needed to go through a series of negotiations and processes before it could be formalized . 

the philippines(GPE) , india(GPE) and japan(GPE) have separate territorial and maritime disputes with china(GPE) . 

indian(NORP) ambassador shambu(PERSON) kumaran(PERSON) underscored the need for the three(CARDINAL) countries to join forces and focus on maritime security in addition to their bilateral relations with each other . 

“ the geopolitical logic of this partnership is very visible given the recent developments in the region , especially the maritime domain . naturally , both india(GPE) and japan(GPE) have prioritized our partnership with the philippines(GPE) in the area of maritime security and i would think that the maritime domain will be a possible area for us to work together , ” kumaran(PERSON) said . 

cruise missiles 

the philippines(GPE) and india(GPE) have upgraded their military ties with the purchase by manila of an p18.9 - billion indian(NORP) missile defense system . 

the brahmos supersonic cruise missiles are expected to arrive “ within the(DATE) first(DATE) quarter(DATE) ”(DATE) of(DATE) 2024(DATE) , a senior military official privy to the brahmos deal but was not authorized to speak to the press told the inquirer . 

the philippines(GPE) and brahmos(ORG) aerospace(ORG) private(ORG) ltd.—an indian(NORP) -(NORP) russian(NORP) joint venture — signed a deal in january(DATE) 2022(DATE) for three(CARDINAL) batteries of the world ’s fastest cruise missiles as part the(ORG) philippine(ORG) navy(ORG) ’s shore - based antiship missile system project . 

manila(GPE) is the first(ORDINAL) foreign customer of the brahmos missiles .

dead-russian-spacecraft-almost-collided-195039436.html : 

a dead russian(NORP) spacecraft almost collided with a nasa(ORG) satellite . the crash could have sent 7,500(CARDINAL) bits of debris rocketing around earth(LOC) . 

nasa(ORG) 's timed satellite narrowly avoided colliding with a dead russian(NORP) spacecraft this(DATE) week(DATE) . 

in the worst - case scenario , the collision could have ejected up to 7,500(CARDINAL) bits of debris into orbit . 

satellite collisions are becoming more likely as the amount of space junk in low - earth orbit grows . 

two(CARDINAL) satellites nearly collided in space on wednesday(DATE) in a harrowing encounter that leolabs , a satellite - tracking company , called " too close for comfort . " 

nasa(ORG) 's thermosphere ionosphere mesosphere energetics and dynamics , or timed , satellite passed by russia(GPE) 's inoperative cosmos 2221(CARDINAL) spacecraft with less(QUANTITY) than(QUANTITY) 65(QUANTITY) feet(QUANTITY) of clearance . that 's shorter than the length of a tennis court . 

these satellites are non - maneuverable , meaning neither the us(GPE) nor russia(GPE) have control over where they go . 

if they had collided , it could have decimated both satellites , blasting up(CARDINAL) to(CARDINAL) 7,500(CARDINAL) fragments of space junk into earth(LOC) 's orbit that would now be zooming around our planet at thousands(QUANTITY) of(QUANTITY) miles(QUANTITY) an(QUANTITY) hour(QUANTITY) , faster than bullets . 

the fragments would n't have posed a danger to life on earth because any debris that penetrated our atmosphere would have burned up during free fall . 

but it would have threatened future spaceflight and astronaut lives since the resulting debris could have made navigating low - earth orbit far more treacherous . 

" there are ' bad neighborhoods ' where these massive derelicts are accumulating preferentially , " darren(PERSON) mcknight(PERSON) , leolabs(ORG) '(ORG) senior technical fellow , told business insider in an email . 

avoiding collisions in these congested areas is becoming increasingly difficult as the number of objects in earth(LOC) 's orbit grows yearly(DATE) . 

earth(LOC) 's orbit is getting overcrowded 

near collisions between large space objects like this are rare , but it only takes one to completely change the landscape of earth(LOC) 's orbit and endanger countless other satellites , space telescopes , and even the international space station , or iss . 

two(CARDINAL) satellite collisions in 2007(DATE) and 2009(DATE) increased the concentration of large debris in low - earth orbit by roughly(PERCENT) 70(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) . 

and with the advent of mega - constellations of internet satellites , such as spacex(PERSON) 's starlink(ORG) and amazon(ORG) 's(ORG) kuiper(ORG) , the number of objects in low - earth orbit is growing more and more each year , increasing the risk of collisions . 

in 2007(DATE) , scientists estimated there were about(CARDINAL) 10,000(CARDINAL) low - earth objects . by 2021(DATE) , that number had doubled . and most of it is n't even useful — it 's space junk . 

roughly(PERCENT) 70(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) of low - earth objects are pieces of debris from damaged or defunct rockets , satellites , and nonoperational payloads , according to leolabs . 

that 's just what 's cataloged , though . 

the(ORG) european(ORG) space(ORG) agency(ORG) estimates that nearly(CARDINAL) 1(CARDINAL) million(CARDINAL) bits of debris measuring between(CARDINAL) one(CARDINAL) and(CARDINAL) 10(QUANTITY) centimeters(QUANTITY) are circling earth , with another 130(CARDINAL) million(CARDINAL) bits even smaller than that . 

space junk is so pervasive the iss sometimes has to navigate around it . 

in march(DATE) 2023(DATE) , the iss dodged objects twice in one(DATE) month(DATE) , once to avoid a collision with a satellite and again to maneuver around debris a(DATE) few(DATE) days(DATE) later(DATE) . 

even the tiniest pieces of debris can damage the space station and endanger astronauts , though no astronaut has lost their life due to space debris — yet . 

the race to clean up space 

the consequences of space debris are very real , so much so that the worst - case scenario has a name : kessler(ORG) syndrome(ORG) . 

in this scenario , a collision sets off a chain reaction , generating a catastrophic domino effect that produces so much space debris that no spacecraft can safely leave earth for hundreds(CARDINAL) or(CARDINAL) thousands(CARDINAL) of years . 

but preventing collisions today(DATE) can offset a possible kessler(ORG) - syndrome scenario in the future . and some governments and private companies have begun to address the problem . 

new space - industry norms and policies in some countries are prompting satellite operators to design their spacecraft to self - destruct when they die by pushing themselves into a free fall that causes them to burn up in the atmosphere . 

last(DATE) year(DATE) , the fcc(ORG) — the us(GPE) agency that regulates most communications satellites — took its first(ORDINAL) - ever enforcement action related to space debris when it fined dish network $ 150,000(MONEY) for failing to properly dispose of a retired satellite . 

some governments seem less concerned . both india(GPE) and russia(GPE) have tested anti - satellite missiles by destroying their own satellites in orbit , creating new clouds of debris . 

as for old , inoperable spacecraft roaming loose in orbit , such as cosmos 2221(DATE) , nasa(ORG) is outsourcing research and development to private companies to collect them . 

in september(DATE) 2023(DATE) , the space agency awarded $ 850,000(MONEY) to transastra for their concept of " flytrap " space - debris capture bags — basically , giant high - tech trash bags to scoop up a lot of space junk . 

outside the us(GPE) , other companies are coming up with their own innovative disposal solutions . the japanese(NORP) company astroscale(PRODUCT) designed a spacecraft with a magnetic plate that can attach to dead satellites and pull them into free fall . 

but these space clean - up technologies are still in testing . the european(NORP) space agency plans to be the first(ORDINAL) to remove a piece of debris from earth(LOC) 's orbit with its clearspace-1 mission , scheduled to launch in 2026(DATE) . 

meanwhile , leolabs hopes that its precision data on objects in orbit will help satellite operators foresee and avoid near collisions like the one that happened wednesday(DATE) .

meghalaya : suspected smuggler killed in bsf firing near indo - bangla border 

a suspected sugar smuggler was shot dead by security forces in meghalaya near the indo - bangladesh border , with his accomplice injured in the firing . 

shillong(PERSON) : the security forces in meghalaya allegedly shot dead a suspected sugar smuggler while his accomplice was injured in firing near the indo - bangaldesh international border , officials said on saturday(DATE) . 

officials said that one(CARDINAL) asen m marak , in his mid - forties , was killed in the firing from bsf meghalaya frontier on march(DATE) 1(DATE) . 

the identity and whereabouts of his accomplice , who is believed to have been hit in the leg , are being ascertained by both police and bsf currently , said officials . 

confirming the incident , sohra sub - divisional officer ( civil ) salon verma said the matter is under inquiry and all formalities are being followed . “ i will personally conduct the inquest after the investigating team returns to the base with all relevant information gathered . the postmortem will be conducted here in sohra , and thereafter , the law will take its course towards a logical conclusion , ” she told ht over the phone from sohra . 

officials said that the incident took place at dalia(GPE) village near shella(GPE) in meghalaya ’s east khasi hills district at around(TIME) 8(TIME) pm(TIME) , when a bsf posse on duty came upon a group of people allegedly trying to smuggle sugar , onion , and other materials that fetch a hefty price in bangladesh(GPE) . 

sharing preliminary details of the incident , a senior bsf officer said though such acts occur frequently , it was different this time as about(CARDINAL) 300(CARDINAL) people from both sides of the international border converged at the spot and confronted the bsf team , which after resorting to all legal measures to contain the crowd , had to resort to two(CARDINAL) rounds of firing resulting in the death of marak(PERSON) . 

“ almost(CARDINAL) 300(CARDINAL) people from both sides of the border converged at the site to confront the bsf personnel . while a group engaged with the bsf personnel , another group quickly took the head load of contraband to remove any evidence of smuggling along with the person who was alive then , to the village where he succumbed to his injuries , ” the officer , who did not wish to be named , told ht over the phone . 

the officer elaborated , “ the boys initially used all non - lethal measures such as chilli grenade , stun grenade , and even pag(GPE) ( pump action gun ) to quell the growing aggressive crowd . but they ( the crowd ) attacked the team with machetes , knives and other weapons . ”

cdc(ORG) updates guidelines on covid isolation 

the updated guideline emphasizes staying home when sick and returning to regular activities once fever - free for 24(TIME) hours(TIME) . this change reflects decreasing severe outcomes of covid and the acknowledgment that many people do not test themselves for the virus .

the experiences of california(GPE) and oregon(GPE) , which already adopted similar guidelines , indicated no increase in covid - related emergency visits or hospitalizations . 

despite criticism , the cdc(ORG) encourages continued caution for five(DATE) days(DATE) after recovery , including mask use and improved ventilation . 

the new guidance , applicable to the general public , does n't alter hospital isolation guidelines , typically lasting ten(DATE) days(DATE) . 

while the cdc(ORG) appeals to covid-19(DATE) vaccination , indicates hygiene practices , and promotes for enhanced ventilation , the agency foresees a possible uptick in cases later in the(DATE) summer(DATE) and advocates a booster shot for adults 65(DATE) and older . 

individuals recovering from covid-19(DATE) are no longer needed to monitor a five(DATE) -(DATE) day(DATE) confinement period after their manifestation descends , as per the recent guidance from the u.s(GPE) .(GPE) centers for disease control and prevention .

cdc(ORG) reduces 5(DATE) -(DATE) day(DATE) isolation for positive results 

the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc(ORG) ) announced on friday(DATE) that it is phasing out much of its specific covid-19 guidance , including the recommendation for americans(NORP) to stay home for five(DATE) days(DATE) after testing positive . 

the decision stems from improved hospitalization and death rates during the(DATE) recent(DATE) covid-19(DATE) season(DATE) , with the cdc(ORG) noting that while covid-19(DATE) remains a public health threat , its impact now resembles that of other respiratory viral illnesses . 

instead of providing separate covid-19(DATE) recommendations , the cdc(ORG) will adopt a unified approach addressing risk alongside influenza and respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) . 

the shift aims to simplify guidelines for increased adherence . the new guidance covers testing recommendations , emphasizing testing for those at higher risk and considering it as an additional prevention strategy for others . 

masking is advised for those sick with covid-19(DATE) or other respiratory viruses for five(DATE) days(DATE) after leaving home , along with distancing and improved ventilation . 

the cdc(ORG) acknowledges challenges with at - home testing accuracy and the impracticality of repeated testing throughout illness . 

the guidance also eliminates specific benchmarks tied to county - by - county mask recommendations , opting for broader tools and community information . health care facility guidance remains unchanged . 

the(PERSON) cdc(PERSON) ends the five(DATE) -(DATE) day(DATE) isolation plea , suggesting individuals with respiratory virus symptoms stay home until fever - free for 24(TIME) hours(TIME) without medication and symptom improvement . 

the decision aligns with states and countries adopting similar recommendations , emphasizing the absence of increased hospitalizations or deaths . the following five(DATE) days(DATE) require additional precautions , considering potential residual virus spread .

akufo(NORP) - addos - bizarre - attempt - to - exonerate - bawumia - from - economic - mess - will - fail - suhuyini : 

the member of parliament for tamale(ORG) north(ORG) , alhassan(ORG) suhuyini , has strongly criticized president nana(PERSON) addo(PERSON) dankwa(PERSON) akufo(PERSON) -(PERSON) addo(PERSON) for attempting to dissociate his vice , dr(PERSON) mahamudu(PERSON) bawumia(PERSON) , from the current economic crisis . 

during his state of the nation address on tuesday(DATE) ,(DATE) february(DATE) 27(DATE) , the president unequivocally accepted responsibility for the current economic challenges , emphasizing that executive powers are ultimately vested in the president . 

the president acknowledged that the accountability for challenges rests squarely with the president . this statement follows recent comments by vice president dr(PERSON) mahamudu(PERSON) bawumia(PERSON) . he clarified that the economic management team ( emt ) , which he leads , does not have decision - making authority and solely provides advisory services to the cabinet . 

in an interview on the big issue on citi(ORG) tv(ORG) , suhuyini , along with other stakeholders , believes that the vice president can not be absolved of the economic crisis . 

he asserted that dr(PERSON) bawumia(PERSON) , who plays a significant role on the economic management team ( emt ) , should take full responsibility for the hardships the country is currently facing . 

the mp for tamale north criticized the president for praising his vice and reversing his stance . 

“ the exoneration and responsibility , the president in his state of the nation address in 2018(DATE) said that ‘ i ’m glad to be able to report that the economic management team , under the stellar leadership of the strong , brilliant , economist , vice president dr(PERSON) bawumia(PERSON) has risen to the challenge and the hard work is beginning to show positive results ’ . that was the president informing us who was in charge of the programmes they were implementing as far as emt(ORG) was concerned . 

he further asserted , “ suddenly , because things are bad , the president now says that he ’s responsible . but even in that same breath , he says that when it comes to digitalization , he ’s responsible [ bawumia ] . it ’s an irony , what a bizarre attempt to repackage and sell a very bad product to the people of ghana(GPE) . 

“ why is there the need to distance him now from this very bad economic record , when you told us that under the economy wizard ’s leadership that is why you were doing well . ”

young advocates for natural gas at algiers(GPE) summit 

minister of energy and energy industries stuart young advocated for the use of natural gas as a transition fuel , stressing the importance of using sovereign resources and ensuring energy security , at an extraordinary ministerial meeting on march(DATE) 1(DATE) . 

young , along with a delegation from his ministry representing the government , attended the 7th(ORDINAL) gas exporting countries forum ( gecf(PERSON) ) summit in algiers(GPE) , the(GPE) democratic(GPE) republic(GPE) of algeria(GPE) . 

speaking at the international conference centre abdelatif rahal in algiers(GPE) , algeria(GPE) he said , 

" it is incumbent upon us to raise our voices globally in the conversation of energy security and food security , demand the ability and the opportunities to utilise our sovereign resources , and work together not only in the promotion of the use of natural gas . " 

young said natural gas would inevitably remain a prominent energy source for decades(DATE) to come and called for a clean energy environment , stressing the importance of collectively exploiting national gas resources . 

" trinidad(GPE) and tobago(GPE) , as small as it is , continues to play a vital role in providing energy security , not only for latin(LOC) america(LOC) and the caricom region but also as far away as europe(LOC) . i call upon us once again to use the body of the gecf to raise the platform and the voices for natural gas . " 

he urged support for the african continent 's ability to independently develop its resources for energy security , citing the tt dragon gas deal , which involved two(CARDINAL) gecf member countries , as an example of a project facilitating resource development . 

young concluded by anticipating closer collaboration as a united voice , saying , " sometimes we need to push back on those who make decisions in far - off places that directly affect our ability to develop our own resources . " 

the gecf(PERSON) summit serves as a meeting of heads of state and government from the member countries of the gecf , providing a platform for leaders to discuss and share insights on recent developments and future perspectives on energy , particularly natural gas . the summit ends with the issuing of the algiers declaration .

rjxjr4epp(ORG) : 

u.s(GPE) .(GPE) president joe(PERSON) biden(PERSON) announced on friday(DATE) plans to carry out a first(ORDINAL) military airdrop of food and supplies into gaza(GPE) , a(DATE) day(DATE) after the deaths of palestinians(NORP) queuing for aid threw a spotlight on an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe in the crowded coastal enclave . 

read more : 

biden(PERSON) said the(ORG) u.s(ORG) .(ORG) airdrop(ORG) would take place in the(DATE) coming(DATE) days(DATE) but offered no further specifics . other countries , including jordan(GPE) and france(GPE) , have already carried out airdrops of aid into gaza(GPE) . " we need to do more and the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) will do more , " biden(PERSON) told reporters , adding that " aid flowing to gaza(GPE) is nowhere nearly enough . " 

at the(ORG) white(ORG) house(ORG) , spokesperson john(PERSON) kirby(PERSON) stressed that airdrops would become " a sustained effort . " he added that the first(ORDINAL) airdrop would be likely be military mres , or " meals ready - to - eat , " adding " this is n’t going to be one and done . " 

biden(PERSON) told reporters that the u.s(GPE) .(GPE) was also looking at the possibility of a maritime corridor to deliver large amounts of aid into gaza(GPE) . the airdrops could begin as(DATE) early(DATE) as(DATE) this(DATE) weekend(DATE) , officials said . 

at(CARDINAL) least(CARDINAL) 576,000(CARDINAL) people in the(GPE) gaza(GPE) strip(GPE) -(GPE) one quarter of the enclave 's population - are one(CARDINAL) step away from famine , according to the u.n . office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs . gaza(GPE) 's hamas(ORG) health(ORG) authorities(ORG) said israeli(NORP) forces had killed more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 100(CARDINAL) people trying to reach a relief convoy near gaza(GPE) city(GPE) early on thursday(DATE) . palestinians(NORP) face an increasingly desperate situation nearly(DATE) five(DATE) months(DATE) into the war that began with a hamas(ORG) attack on israel(GPE) on oct(DATE) .(DATE) 7(DATE) . 

israel(GPE) blamed most of the deaths on crowds that swarmed around aid trucks , saying victims had been trampled or run over . an israeli(NORP) official also said troops had " in a limited response " later fired on crowds they felt had posed a threat . 

with people eating animal feed and even cactuses to survive , and with medics saying children are dying in hospitals from malnutrition and dehydration , the u.n(GPE) .(GPE) has said it faces " overwhelming obstacles " getting in aid . 

while it is unclear which type of aircraft will be used , the c-17 and c-130 are best suited for the job . david(PERSON) deptula(PERSON) , a retired u.s(GPE) .(GPE) air force three(CARDINAL) - star general who once commanded the no - fly zone over northern iraq(GPE) , said airdrops are something the u.s(GPE) .(GPE) military can effectively execute . " it is something that 's right up their mission alley , " deptula(ORG) told reuters(ORG) . " there are a lot of detailed challenges . but there 's nothing insurmountable . " 

the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) and others also expect aid would be boosted by a temporary ceasefire , which biden(ORG) said friday(DATE) he hoped would happen by the time of the muslim(NORP) fasting month of ramadan , which starts on march(DATE) 10(DATE) . 

israel(GPE) ' aware ' of airdrop 

still , there have been questions about the effectiveness of air dropping aid into gaza(GPE) . a u.s(GPE) .(GPE) official , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said the airdrops would have only a limited impact on the suffering of those in gaza(GPE) . 

" it does n't deal with the root cause , " the official said , adding that ultimately only opening up land borders could deal with the issue in a serious manner . 

another issue , the official added , was that the u.s(GPE) .(GPE) could not ensure that the aid simply did n’t end up in hamas(ORG) ’ hands , given that the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) did not have troops on the ground . 

" humanitarian workers always complain that airdrops are good photo opportunities but a lousy way to deliver aid , " richard(PERSON) gowan(PERSON) , the international crisis group 's u.n(ORG) .(ORG) director , said . gowan(ORG) said that the only way to get enough aid was through aid convoys which would follow a truce . " it is arguable that the situation in gaza(GPE) is now so bad that any additional supplies will at least alleviate some suffering . but this at best a temporary band aid measure , " gowan(PERSON) added . 

under pressure at home and abroad , another u.s(GPE) .(GPE) official said the biden administration was looking at shipping aid by sea from cyprus(GPE) , some(QUANTITY) 210(QUANTITY) nautical(QUANTITY) miles(QUANTITY) off gaza(GPE) 's mediterranean(LOC) coast(LOC) . 

at the(ORG) white(ORG) house(ORG) , kirby(PERSON) acknowledged that the airdrops into gaza(GPE) were " extremely difficult " because of the dense population and ongoing conflict . 

the u.s(GPE) .(GPE) for months(DATE) has been calling for israel(GPE) to allow more aid into gaza(GPE) , something israel(GPE) has resisted . kirby(PERSON) noted that israel(GPE) had tried to airdrop supplies into gaza(GPE) and it was supportive of the u.s(GPE) .(GPE) airdropping aid . " we are aware of the humanitarian airdrop , " said an israeli(NORP) official in washington(GPE) . 

the official , speaking on condition of anonymity , did not reply to a question on whether the u.s(GPE) .(GPE) had sought israeli(NORP) agreement in advance on the air drops or was coordinating the effort with it . 

biden(PERSON) 's announcement of the fresh aid to gaza(GPE) was marred by gaffes as he twice confused it for ukraine(GPE) . 

the u.n(ORG) .(ORG) delivered aid to besieged northern(GPE) gaza(GPE) for the first(ORDINAL) time in over a week on friday(DATE) , said the u.n(ORG) .(ORG) office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs . the u.n(ORG) .(ORG) delivered medicines , vaccines and fuel to al(ORG) -(ORG) shifa(ORG) hospital(ORG) in gaza(GPE) city(GPE) . 

the(ORG) world(ORG) food(ORG) program(ORG) said 10(DATE) days(DATE) ago(DATE) that it was pausing deliveries of food aid to northern(GPE) gaza(GPE) until conditions in the palestinian(NORP) enclave allow for safe distribution . 

the u.n . palestinian(NORP) refugee agency unrwa(PERSON) said on friday(DATE) that during february(DATE) an average of nearly(CARDINAL) 97(CARDINAL) trucks were able to enter gaza(GPE) each(DATE) day(DATE) , compared with about(CARDINAL) 150(CARDINAL) trucks a day in january(DATE) , adding : " the number of trucks entering gaza(GPE) remains well below the target of 500(DATE) per(DATE) day(DATE) .

bill - would - rid - of - foreign - contributions - for - issue - campaigns - in - ohio : 

columbus(GPE) , ohio(GPE) ( wcmh ) – some lawmakers at the ohio statehouse are worried about foreign influence on elections , specifically issue - based campaigns . that is why senators theresa(PERSON) gavarone(PERSON) ( r - bowling green ) and rob mccolley(PERSON) ( r - napoleon ) brought forward senate(ORG) bill 215(CARDINAL) . 

“ are we against foreign money in elections or not , ” mccolley(PERSON) said . “ it ’s as simple as that . ” 

“ the smell test on this one is that it seems like a sore loser response , ” ohio(ORG) senate(ORG) minority leader nickie(PERSON) antonio(PERSON) ( d - lakewood ) said . 

state and federal law does already prohibit foreign contributions to candidates . but for issue campaigns like the reproductive rights and marijuana legalization measures in november(DATE) — the door was left open to overseas donors . sb215(PERSON) passed the senate(ORG) on wednesday(DATE) , on partly lines , 25(CARDINAL) to seven(CARDINAL) . 

“ we want to shut that door and stop foreign interference in all our elections , ” gavarone(PERSON) said . “ a no vote says that for them to meddle in our elections is not only acceptable but encouraged . ” 

republicans(NORP) use the latest issue election as an example . millions(MONEY) of(MONEY) dollars(MONEY) poured into the reproductive rights campaign , including millions(MONEY) of(MONEY) dollars(MONEY) of contributions from the sixteen(DATE) thirty(DATE) fund , a group heavily supported by a swiss(NORP) billionaire . 

demora said he does n’t have a problem with the group giving money to the abortion - rights ballot issue , because the group did n’t do anything illegal . 

“ it is not solely in response to that , ” senate(ORG) president matt(PERSON) huffman(PERSON) ( r(PERSON) -(PERSON) lima(PERSON) ) said . “ but it ’s an ongoing problem and i think the practical matter is , for a lot of elections , folks outside of ohio(GPE) care about what ’s going on . ” 

senator bill(PERSON) demora(PERSON) ( d - columbus ) said , he agrees , foreign influence is not necessarily good , but said either way , millions(MONEY) of(MONEY) dollars(MONEY) are poured into ohio(GPE) elections from out of state . 

“ the campaign got money from a foundation that got money from a foreign national , who ’s to say that the money the foreign national put in there is the same money the ohio(GPE) ballot issue got , ” he said . “ i do n’t know what the difference between a billionaire from canada(GPE) and switzerland(GPE) is versus a billionaire from texas(GPE) . ” 

huffman(ORG) said the bill should be passed to minimize election influence by people outside of ohio(GPE) . 

the bill also prohibits “ a lawful permanent u.s(GPE) .(GPE) resident , also known as a green card holder , ” from making contributions both to ballot issues and candidates . 

demora said the language in the bill will discourage participation in the election process , like collecting signatures for ballot issues , even for things as simple as adding a stop sign on a street . 

“ they now have to file as a pac because they ’re spending money and collecting signatures for a ballot issue , which is absolutely ludicrous , ” demora said . “ republicans(NORP) have passed this whole convoluted mess . ” 

demora , and other democrats(NORP) , said they worry this bill will have a chilling effect on grassroots efforts to put issues on ballots . 

“ the point of this bill is so that a guy in switzerland(GPE) who wants to give $(MONEY) 10(MONEY) million(MONEY) to effect a ballot issue in ohio(GPE) wo n’t be able to do that , ” huffman(PERSON) said . 

the bill is still in the statehouse ; the next step for approval is the(ORG) ohio(ORG) house(ORG) . if it passes before august(DATE) , it will take effect before the november(DATE) election .

older u.s(GPE) .(GPE) adults should roll up their sleeves for another covid-19 shot , even if they got a booster in the(DATE) fall(DATE) , u.s(GPE) .(GPE) health officials said wednesday(DATE) . 

the centers for disease control and prevention said americans(NORP) 65(CARDINAL) and older should get another dose of the updated vaccine that became available in september(DATE) — if at(DATE) least(DATE) four(DATE) months(DATE) has passed since their last shot . in making the recommendation , the agency endorsed guidance proposed by an expert advisory panel earlier(DATE) in(DATE) the(DATE) day(DATE) . 

“ most covid-19(DATE) deaths and hospitalizations last(DATE) year(DATE) were among people 65(DATE) years(DATE) and older . an additional vaccine dose can provide added protection ... for those at highest risk , ” cdc(ORG) director dr(PERSON) .(PERSON) mandy(PERSON) cohen(PERSON) said in a statement . 

the advisory panel ’s decision came after a lengthy discussion about whether to say older people “ may ” get the shots or if they “ should ” do so . that reflects a debate among experts about how necessary another booster is and whether yet another recommendation would add to the public ’s growing vaccine fatigue . 

some doctors say most older adults are adequately protected by the fall shot , which built on immunity derived from earlier vaccinations and exposure to the virus itself . and preliminary studies so far have shown no substantial waning in vaccine effectiveness over six(DATE) months(DATE) . 

however , the body ’s vaccine - induced defenses tend to fade over time , and that happens faster in seniors than in other adults . the committee had recommended covid-19 booster doses for older adults in 2022(DATE) and 2023(DATE) . 

covid-19(DATE) remains a danger , especially to older people and those with underlying medical conditions . there are still more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 20,000(CARDINAL) hospitalizations and more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 2,000(CARDINAL) deaths each(DATE) week(DATE) due to the coronavirus , according to the cdc . and people 65(CARDINAL) and older have the highest hospitalization and death rates . 

some members of the advisory panel said a “ should ” recommendation is meant to more clearly prod doctors and pharmacists to offer the shots . 

“ most people are coming in either wanting the vaccine or not , ” said dr . jamie(PERSON) loehr(PERSON) , a committee member and family doctor in ithaca(LOC) , new(GPE) york(GPE) . “ i am trying to make it easier for providers to say , ‘ yes , we recommend this . ’ ” 

in september(DATE) , the government recommended a new covid-19 shot recipe built against a version of the coronavirus called xbb.1.5 . that single - target vaccine replaced combination shots that had been targeting both the original coronavirus strain and a much earlier omicron version . 

the cdc(ORG) recommended the new shots for everyone 6(DATE) months(DATE) and older , and allowed that people with weak immune systems could get a second(ORDINAL) dose as(DATE) early(DATE) as(DATE) two(DATE) months(DATE) after the first(ORDINAL) . 

most americans(NORP) have n’t listened . according to the latest cdc(ORG) data , 13(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) of u.s(GPE) .(GPE) children have gotten the shots and about(PERCENT) 22(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) of u.s(GPE) .(GPE) adults have . the vaccination rate is higher for adults 65(DATE) and older , at nearly(PERCENT) 42(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) . 

“ in each successive vaccine , the uptake has gone down , ” said dr . david(PERSON) canaday(PERSON) , a case western(ORG) reserve(ORG) university(ORG) infectious diseases expert who studies covid-19(PERSON) in older people . 

“ people are tired of getting all these shots all the time , ” said canaday , who does not serve on the committee . “ we have to be careful about over - recommending the vaccine . ” 

but there is a subset of americans(NORP) — those at higher danger of severe illness and death — who have been asking if another dose is permissible , said dr(PERSON) .(PERSON) william(PERSON) schaffner(PERSON) , a vanderbilt university vaccines expert who serves on a committee workgroup that has been debating the booster question . 

indeed , cdc(ORG) survey data suggests that group ’s biggest worry about the vaccine is whether it ’s effective enough . 

agency officials say that among those who got the latest version of the covid-19(GPE) vaccine , 50(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) fewer will get sick after they come into contact with the virus compared with those who did n’t get the fall shot .

dr(PERSON) salmi(PERSON) ’s journey through the rafah crossing into the heart of rafah city was fraught with danger , but he was determined to help injured palestinians(NORP) with healthcare facilities in the occupied territories on the brink of collapse .

“ i am glad to be here to assist the injured , particularly children , but i am also deeply saddened by the significant number of casualties , ” he said . 

he shed light on the calamitous conditions in gaza(GPE) , including food scarcity and the relentless threat posed by airstrikes , which have not spared even hospitals putting the lives of the displaced seeking refuge in jeopardy . 

“ the hospitals themselves face significant risks , shaking from bomb attacks multiple times a day . missiles land near hospitals , further intensifying the challenges . 

“ the people of gaza(GPE) know that arab(NORP) nations will not abandon them . their joy and relief upon receiving support is immeasurable , ” he said , expressing his gratitude for the support that made his participation in this critical mission possible .

fgn21-us-pak-govt.html(PERSON) : 

washington(GPE) , mar(DATE) 1(DATE) ( pti(ORG) ) citing " strong evidence " of election rigging in pakistan(GPE) , a group of influential lawmakers , including muslim(NORP) legislators , belonging to the ruling democratic(ORG) party(ORG) has urged us(GPE) president joe(PERSON) biden(PERSON) to withhold " recognition " of a new government in islamabad(GPE) until a transparent and credible investigation is conducted . 

the february(DATE) 8(DATE) general election , marred by allegations of widespread rigging , in pakistan(GPE) , resulted in a hung parliament with independent candidates backed by jailed former prime minister imran(PERSON) khan(PERSON) 's pakistan(GPE) tehreek - e - insaf ( pti(ORG) ) party winning more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 90(CARDINAL) seats at the 266(CARDINAL) - member national assembly . ex - premier nawaz sharif(ORG) 's pml(ORG) -(ORG) n(ORG) bagged 75(CARDINAL) seats and former foreign minister bilawal(PERSON) bhutto(PERSON) 's(PERSON) ppp(ORG) got 54(CARDINAL) seats . the muttahida(PERSON) qaumi(PERSON) movement pakistan(GPE) ( mqm(ORG) -(ORG) p(ORG) ) won 17(CARDINAL) seats . 

in a joint letter to president biden(PERSON) and secretary of state(ORG) antony(PERSON) blinken(PERSON) , the lawmakers expressed concerns about " pre- and post - poll rigging in pakistan(GPE) ’s recent parliamentary elections " and urged the us congress to " withhold recognition of a new government in pakistan(GPE) until a thorough , transparent , and credible investigation of election interference has been conducted " . 

islamabad(GPE) is a long - standing ally of washington(GPE) and it is in the interest of the us(GPE) to ensure that democracy thrives in pakistan(GPE) and that election results reflect the interests of the pakistani(NORP) people , not the interests of the pakistani(NORP) elite and military , the letter sent on wednesday(DATE) said . 

since the election resulted in a hung parliament , the(ORG) pakistan(ORG) muslim(ORG) league(ORG) -(ORG) nawaz(ORG) ( pml - n ) and the(ORG) pakistan(ORG) peoples(ORG) party(ORG) ((ORG) ppp(ORG) ) have struck a post - poll deal along with four(CARDINAL) other parties to form a coalition government , which may effectively end khan(PERSON) 's chances of returning to power . a party must win 133(CARDINAL) out of 265(CARDINAL) contested seats in the 266(CARDINAL) - member national assembly to form a government . 

pti(ORG) has rejected the attempts by the(ORG) pml(ORG) -(ORG) n(ORG) and the ppp(ORG) to form a coalition government , warning that robbing its public endorsement by the " mandate thieves " will result in the worst political instability . 

" given the strong evidence of pre- and post - poll rigging , we urge you to wait until a thorough , transparent , and credible investigation has been conducted before recognising a new pakistani(NORP) government . without taking this necessary step , you risk enabling anti - democratic behaviour by pakistani(NORP) authorities and could undermine the democratic(NORP) will of the pakistani(NORP) people , " the us(GPE) lawmakers said . 

the letter urged pakistani(NORP) authorities to release anyone who has been detained for engaging in political speech or activity and tasked state department officials in pakistan(GPE) with gathering information about such cases and advocating for their release . 

it urged the biden administration to " make clear " to pakistani(NORP) authorities that us(GPE) law provides for accountability for acts that violate human rights , undermine democracy , or further corruption , " including the potential for military and other cooperation to be halted " . 

the letter noted that before the elections , former prime minister khan(PERSON) was sentenced to prison terms of 10(DATE) years(DATE) and 14(DATE) years(DATE) on " questionable charges " of leaking state secrets and corruption . members of his pti party " were forced " to run as independents and prohibited from using the party symbol on the ballot , " despite consistently polling as the most popular party in the country " . 

" leading up to the election . pti(ORG) members faced police raids , arrests , and harassment . on the(DATE) day(DATE) of the election , pakistani(NORP) authorities suspended mobile calls and data , making it harder for voters to find polling stations , " the lawmakers noted . 

while the pre - poll rigging efforts rightly received widespread international and domestic condemnation , attention has now turned to widespread allegations of past - poll rigging , they said . 

" concerns arose after delays in reporting final results and early returns showed pti - backed candidates on a path to victory . over the(DATE) coming(DATE) days(DATE) and weeks(DATE) , previously reported vote totals allegedly changed dramatically , while video evidence emerged on social media of purported abuses by security forces and election officials at polling stations , as results were delayed well past legal deadlines , " the letter said . 

the legislators noted that findings by nonpartisan observers also lend credibility to these concerns . 

according to the free and fair election network ( fafen ) , which is nonpartisan but has worked closely with election authorities , more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) two(CARDINAL) -(CARDINAL) thirds(CARDINAL) of polling sites suffered from the kinds of election law violations that could have enabled changing outcomes of races , they noted , adding that these findings were echoed by other election monitors , human rights organisations , and the nation 's media as well . 

" this growing body of evidence and diversity of voices has led many of the leading observers , human rights organisations , and media organisations to call for a transparent , credible audit process to verify the true outcome of the election , " they emphasised , urging the biden administration " to show pakistanis(NORP) that the us(GPE) stands with them in their fight for democracy and human rights " . 

according to a report in pakistan(GPE) 's dawn(TIME) newspaper , all 33(CARDINAL) signatories are pivotal progressive democrats(NORP) essential for securing president biden(PERSON) ’s second(ORDINAL) term . 

it noted that influential muslim(NORP) lawmakers -- rashida(PERSON) tlaib(PERSON) , ilhan(PERSON) omar(PERSON) ,(PERSON) and andre(PERSON) carson(PERSON) -- have also endorsed the " pro - pti letter " . 

the letter was also signed by indian(NORP) - origin congresswoman pramila(PERSON) jayapal(PERSON) , the chairperson of the progressive caucus .

the teenage son of an israeli(NORP) diplomat , who was arrested for allegedly running over a police officer with his motorcycle , was beaten in a florida(GPE) jail on wednesday(DATE) during a row over sausages . 

19(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) -(DATE) old(DATE) avraham(PERSON) gil(PERSON) had returned to the miami(GPE) -(GPE) dade(GPE) county jail to provide an updated mugshot when he became embroiled in a heated debate about sausages with another inmate named blake(PERSON) elvis(PERSON) ermus(PERSON) . the teen , who was accused of “ intentionally ” running over a cop , was then beaten by ermus , according to local reports . 

gil told investigators that he “ was having a conversation with the defendant ( ermus ) about the ingredients of the sausages . at some point , the defendant approached the victim and punched him multiple times . ”

32(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) -(DATE) old(DATE) ermus was in jail on domestic battery charges and has since been charged with felony battery by a detainee , jail records show . gil , whose father is the consul for administration at the israeli(NORP) consulate in miami(GPE) , was placed on house arrest after his driving was declared a danger to the public . 

he made national headlines when he was pictured crying in his mugshot after attempting to claim diplomatic immunity following his arrest in january(DATE) . but this was not the teen ’s first(ORDINAL) run - in with miami(GPE) police , as it is believed he previously drove away from a traffic stop and was pulled over on new year(DATE) ’s(DATE) eve(DATE) for several traffic violations . gil(PERSON) ’s bike even featured a number plate that read “ pls(PERSON) chase(PERSON) ” , hidden by a second(ORDINAL) flip - up plate . 

the cop he allegedly ran over is still unable to work and remains in recovery . “ just had a motorcycle come and run me over . i ’ve got one(CARDINAL) subject in custody , ” the police officer said after being hit , local10 reports . 

for all the latest on news , politics , sports , and showbiz from the usa , go to the mirror us 

gil(PERSON) ’s lawyers argued the teen should be granted diplomatic immunity due to his father ’s position . these calls fell on deaf ears as the(ORG) us(ORG) state(ORG) department(ORG) confirmed he was not entitled to civil or criminal immunity . 

at the time of his arrest , legal expert david(PERSON) weinstein(PERSON) told local10 : " diplomatic immunity is not given to people who are called consular officials , and those are people who are not the head diplomatic agent of a foreign country here in the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) , so there is a distinction . ” 

the teen ’s updated mugshot paints a stark contrast to his first(ORDINAL) , with the 19(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) -(DATE) old(DATE) showing very little emotion this time . gil(PERSON) ’s next court appearance is scheduled for march(DATE) 12(DATE) . 

thousands(CARDINAL) of diplomats call the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) their home and dealing with their alleged crimes can often be a delicate and complicated process . as per the vienna convention , diplomats are not liable for arrest or detention , essentially granting them immunity to a wide range of criminal offences .

in his victory speech , galloway(PERSON) took aim at keir(PERSON) starmer(PERSON) , the leader of the main opposition labour party , who according to opinion polls is likely to become britain(GPE) 's prime minister at the general election this(DATE) year(DATE) . 

keir(PERSON) starmer(PERSON) , this is for gaza(GPE) , " he said . " you have paid , and you will pay , a high price for the role that you have played in enabling , encouraging and covering for the catastrophe presently going on in occupied palestine(GPE) in the(GPE) gaza(GPE) strip(GPE) . 

galloway(PERSON) , a former labour member of parliament who was expelled from the party in 2003(DATE) , also declared labour is on notice and a shifting of the tectonic plates " . 

labour said galloway only won because the party pulled its support for its candidate , azhar(PERSON) ali(PERSON) , for suggesting israel(GPE) was complicit in hamas(ORG) ' attack on oct(DATE) 7(DATE) . without the backing of labour , ali(PERSON) ended up coming fourth(ORDINAL) . 

galloway(PERSON) 's victory means that from next(DATE) week(DATE) , parliament will once again be home to one(CARDINAL) of the most eloquent orators from the left wing of uk(GPE) politics , who will clearly use his position to raise his opposition to israel(GPE) 's operation in gaza(GPE) . 

george(PERSON) galloway(PERSON) is someone who stokes up division and fear , " said ellie(PERSON) reeves(PERSON) , labour 's deputy national campaign co - ordinator . " this is n't how we would have wanted this by - election to play out . 

the constituency of rochdale(ORG) has traditionally been a labour seat , one where the governing conservative party makes little headway . its candidate came in third(ORDINAL) . 

galloway(PERSON) , who now leads the workers party of britain(GPE) , started out his political career half(DATE) a(DATE) century(DATE) ago(DATE) as a firebrand left - wing labour mp for a constituency in glasgow(GPE) . 

he has been a controversial figure for decades(DATE) , and faced widespread opposition for meeting in 1994(DATE) the then iraqi(NORP) dictator saddam(PERSON) hussein(PERSON) and telling him : " sir , i salute your courage , your strength , your indefatigability . 

in 2004(DATE) , he returned to parliament as a lawmaker for the anti - war respect party after a special election in a heavily muslim(NORP) seat in east(GPE) london(GPE) , but was defeated at the general election the(DATE) following(DATE) year(DATE) . 

he was elected again at a special election in 2012(DATE) with a swing of 37(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) from labour to respect but lost his seat once more in the election of 2015(DATE) . 

in 2019(DATE) galloway was fired from a talk - radio show for a social media post that the radio station judged antisemitic . 

as well as being an eloquent advocate for his political views , which saw him take us senators to task in 2005(DATE) , galloway(PERSON) has also courted ridicule , most notably in 2006(DATE) when he impersonated a cat in the reality television show celebrity big brother .

abandoned - town - at - bottom - of - lake : 

there is an abandoned town at the bottom of a lake in central(LOC) texas(LOC) 

texas(GPE) has a plethora of ghost towns that are ripe for exploring . just remember to do your research before you do . some of those places could have actually been bought and become private property . if you 're not careful , you could be charged with trespassing . having said that , there is an abandoned town where the access to it is not that easy . why ? because its at the bottom of a lake . 

the story of towash(GPE) , texas(GPE) 

towash(GPE) , texas(GPE) began around 1854(DATE) . folks started moving to the area to work at a wheat and corn mill there . the mill was run by two(CARDINAL) brothers , simpson(PERSON) cash and james(PERSON) harrison(PERSON) dyer(PERSON) . the brothers got permission to build a dam on the(LOC) brazos(LOC) river(LOC) so the flow of water could be directed to run the mill . 

the mill brought in settlers to work but also became a place for social gatherings . this was due to the amount of people that would us the mill . the wait times for use could be up(DATE) to(DATE) two(DATE) days(DATE) so those people would socialize to pass the time . the mill was also used during the civil war to have wool carded to weave clothes and blankets . 

this little town thrived because of the dyer brother 's mill . a post office was established along with a church , a few stores , a blacksmith , a cotton gin and more . 

what happened to the town ? 

in short , the railroad . in the 1880(DATE) 's , the railroad was built in whitney , about(QUANTITY) 25(QUANTITY) miles(QUANTITY) from towash . throughout the(DATE) following(DATE) years(DATE) , residents moved from towash into whitney . the deserted town stood until 1951(DATE) when the(FAC) whitney(FAC) dam(FAC) was built . the dam created lake whitney which engulfed towash(GPE) . 

several of towash(PERSON) 's buildings still remain at the bottom of lake whitney about(QUANTITY) 110(QUANTITY) feet(QUANTITY) down according to many scuba divers . when lake levels are low , you can see some of the town 's foundations . if you put in the coordinates 31.922234,-97.343275(CARDINAL) in google maps and scroll in real close , you can see some of those foundations . 

there are several parks and a state park around lake whitney now . it could be a fun road trip to check out the lake and maybe throw in a scuba diving adventure while you 're there . it would certainly make for some cool pictures or video .

broadcasting - authority - slams - times - now - news-18 - for - love - jihad - narratives : 

the news broadcasters & digital association ( nbdsa(PERSON) ) has slammed times now , aaj(PERSON) tak(PERSON) , and news 18(CARDINAL) for several news reports that set a targeted narrative against muslims(NORP) , particularly concerning ‘ love jihad ’ . ‘ love jihad ’ refers to a bogus claim made by the hindu(NORP) right wing that muslim(NORP) men are ‘ luring ’ hindu women into marriages to convert them to islam(NORP) . times now and news 18(CARDINAL) india(GPE) have both been fined for linking the murder of shraddha walkar to ‘ love jihad ’ and have been told to remove all of the offensive videos . 

in its order to news 18(CARDINAL) india(GPE) , nbdsa(GPE) said , “ the term ‘ love jihad ’ should not be used loosely and should be used with great introspection in future broadcasts as religious stereotyping can corrode the secular fabric of the country , cause irreparable harm to a community and create religious intolerance or disharmony . ” 

times now was also similarly admonished , with the nbdsa(PERSON) warning against “ generalised statements regarding inter - faith marriages by giving it a communal colour . ” they further told times now , “ every citizen , from whichever religion , has a right to marry a person of his / her choice , irrespective of the religion to which he / she belongs . ” 

after the murder of shradda(PERSON) walkar(PERSON) by her live - in partner aaftab(NORP) amin poonawala in november(DATE) 2022(DATE) , times now navbharat and news 18(CARDINAL) aired several segments claiming that the murder was an organised ‘ love jihad ’ crime . taking issue with the misreporting that the murder was religiously motivated , activist indrajeet(PERSON) ghorpade(PERSON) filed complaints with the nbdsa against himanshu(PERSON) dixit(PERSON) from times now navbharat and against news 18(CARDINAL) india(GPE) ’s aman(PERSON) chopra(PERSON) and amish(PERSON) devgan(PERSON) . 

news 18(CARDINAL) india(GPE) had conducted four(CARDINAL) shows , all making claims of ‘ love jihad ’ in connection to shradda(PERSON) ’s murder . an fir is already pending in rajasthan(GPE) against one of the shows , titled ‘ aar paar amish devgan(PERSON) ke(PERSON) saath(PERSON) | love(ORG) jihad(ORG) |(ORG) shraddha(ORG) murder(ORG) | aftab(ORG) amin(ORG) |(ORG) debate news ’ . noting this , the nbdsa(PERSON) excluded this show alone from its ruling as the matter is pending before a court of law . accordingly , the nbdsa confined its investigation to the following three(CARDINAL) shows conducted by aman(PERSON) and amish : 

love(ORG) jihad(ORG) bahana(ORG) , ek(PERSON) mahzab(PERSON) nishana(PERSON) ? desh(PERSON) nahin(PERSON) jhukne(ORG) denge(ORG) aman(PERSON) chopra(PERSON) ke(PERSON) saath(PERSON) 
(PERSON)
desh(PERSON) nahin(PERSON) jhukne(ORG) denge(ORG) aman(PERSON) chopra(PERSON) ke(PERSON) saath| shraddha(EVENT) murder(EVENT) case | aaftab | mehrauli(WORK_OF_ART) murder(WORK_OF_ART) 

aar(PERSON) paar(PERSON) amish(PERSON) devgan(PERSON) ke(PERSON) saath(PERSON) live | shraddha murder case | aftab(ORG) narco(ORG) test | love jihad 

the nbdsa(PERSON) called it “ inappropriate ” to link shradda(PERSON) ’s murder to ‘ love jihad ’ as the anchors used the “ premise to paint / target an entire community instead of blaming a few miscreants for murder and violence . ” it further said that the targeted narrative “ was evident from the statements made by the anchors during the impugned broadcasts , including the repeated references linking the term love jihad ’ to the shraddha walker murder case and the usage of the hashtag # lovejihadfiles in the second(ORDINAL) and fourth(ORDINAL) broadcasts in relation to a particular community . ” 

apart from being directed to remove the videos , news 18(CARDINAL) india(GPE) has been fined with rs 50,000(CARDINAL) for “ violating the principles of neutrality , impartiality and accuracy under the code of ethics and the specific guidelines covering reportage relating to racial and religious harmony . ” 

similarly , times now navbharat(PERSON) ’s himanshu(PERSON) dixit(PERSON) has been criticised by the nbdsa(PERSON) who said , “ it appears that at the very beginning of the broadcast , the anchor had concluded that men from a certain community lured women from another community by hiding their religious identity and then committed violence or murders against such women and every such violence or murder committed on women of a certain community are related to ‘ love jihad ’ . ” 

“ this is evident from the questions raised and statements made by the anchor during the impugned broadcast . when some of the panellists expressed their concerns regarding the communal angle being given to such alleged incidents and regarding selective cases of violence against women where the perpetrator belonged to a particular community , the anchor shouted them down and did not allow them to express their views , ” the nbdsa further noted . 

the nbdsa(PERSON) also expressly stated , “ there may be some instances where boys from a particular community married hindu girls . however , such instances should not lead to making generalised statements regarding inter - faith marriages by giving them a communal colour . every citizen , from whichever religion , has a right to marry a person of his / her choice , irrespective of the religion to which he / she belongs . merely because a hindu(NORP) girl married a boy of another faith would not be tantamount to ‘ love jihad ’ unless it is established that such a hindu(NORP) girl was duped or coerced into the marriage . further , because of few incidents of such forced marriages , an entire community can not be branded . ” 

the tickers in himanshu(PERSON) ’s show variously claimed : 

“ jihadiyo se beti(PERSON) bachao(PERSON) ” ( “ save girls from jihadis ” ) ; 

“ desh(PERSON) mein(PERSON) love jihad(PERSON) ka(PERSON) sach(PERSON) ( “ the truth about love jihad ” ): church ka(PERSON) dava(PERSON) , 10,000(CARDINAL) isali(PERSON) ladkiya(PERSON) bani(PERSON) shikar(PERSON) ” 

“ desh(PERSON) mein(PERSON) love jihad(PERSON) ka(PERSON) sach(PERSON) : vhp(ORG) ke muatbik 2009(DATE) -(DATE) 2022(DATE) mein 400(CARDINAL) case ” ( “ according to vhp(ORG) there were 400(CARDINAL) love jihad cases in 2009(DATE) -(DATE) 2022(DATE) ” ) 

“ desh(PERSON) mein(PERSON) love jihad(PERSON) ka(PERSON) sach(PERSON) : sirf(ORG) 2023(CARDINAL) mein love jihad(PERSON) ke(PERSON) 153(CARDINAL) case ” ( 153(CARDINAL) cases of love jihad in 2023(DATE) ) 

“ desh(PERSON) mein(PERSON) love jihad(PERSON) ka(PERSON) sach(PERSON) : hyderabad(GPE) mein 2000(CARDINAL) ladkiya(PERSON) gayab(PERSON) , love jihad(PERSON) ka(PERSON) shak ” ( 2000(DATE) women missing in hyderabad(GPE) , love jihad suspected ) . 

times now has been fined rs 1 lakh and told to remove the video from the channel ’s website , youtube(ORG) , and all hyperlinks . 

meanwhile , aaj(PERSON) tak(PERSON) has been pulled up for reports in the wake of the ram navami violence in 2022(DATE) . anchor sudhir(PERSON) chaudhary(PERSON) had claimed that muslim(NORP) - dominated neighbourhoods were dangerous to those of other religions and that such neighbourhoods were “ spreading ” across india(GPE) . sudhir(ORG) aired several offensive tickers that claimed : “ aaj muslim ilaake , kal(PERSON) muslim(PERSON) bharat(PERSON) ” ( today(DATE) a muslim(NORP) neighbourhood , tomorrow(DATE) a muslim(NORP) india ) and “ aaj(PERSON) ilaake(PERSON) , kal(PERSON) zilla(PERSON) , parso(GPE) desh(GPE) ” ( today(DATE) a neighbourhood , tomorrow(DATE) a district and day after that , the whole country ) . sudhir(ORG) also compared the borders of muslim(NORP) neighbourhoods to india(GPE) ’s international borders with china(GPE) and pakistan(GPE) , claiming that the former was just as dangerous to visit as the latter . he further made remarks asking if there were any “ hindu(NORP) , sikh(ORG) , jain(ORG) , parsi(ORG) or christian(NORP) neighbourhoods ” implying that only muslims(NORP) lived in exclusive areas . 

while aaj(PERSON) tak(PERSON) has not been fined , they have been directed to remove the video from their website and youtube . the nbdsa(PERSON) also observed , “ there would have been no problem with the broadcast if the broadcaster had confined its analysis to the incidents of communal violence . however , by broadcasting the following tickers “ aaj mushm(PERSON) ilaake(PERSON) , kal(PERSON) muslim(PERSON) bharat(PERSON) ” and “ aaj(ORG) ilaaka , kal(PERSON) silla(PERSON) , parso(PERSON) desh(PERSON) ” and “ aapne(PERSON) kabhi(PERSON) sikh ya(PERSON) parsi(PERSON) ilaaka suna(PERSON) bai(PERSON) ” during the programme , a completely different colour had been given to the programme . ” 

the nbdsa(GPE) further added , “ incidents of communal violence committed by a few miscreants had been generalised by the anchor to target a particular community . this is evident from the statements made by the anchor in the broadcast . ”

locations within the city generating the most calls for service then get assigned an officer who works in the area to reduce crime . 

“ officers being out there , conducting directed patrols in these areas , having targeted active patrols , being proactive , ” said lt . sexton(PERSON) .

team-biden-hopes-trump-own-170000151.html : 

team biden(PERSON) hopes trump(PERSON) is his own worst enemy with independents 

- oops!something went wrong.please try again later . 

- oops!something went wrong.please try again later . 

- oops!something went wrong.please try again later . 

president biden(PERSON) ’s reelection campaign wants independent swing voters to really hear what former president trump(PERSON) is saying . 

trump(PERSON) gets a lot of news coverage , particularly over his legal problems , which appears to be helping him win the gop(ORG) primary . but the biden campaign thinks that it can emerge victorious in november(DATE) if people are paying more attention to what trump is saying — particularly what he says he ’ll do as president . 

they argue this will turn off independent voters and help biden , who is lagging behind in polls , pull off a reelection win . 

“ we ’re lifting the dangerous and unpopular things donald(PERSON) trump(PERSON) says because it ’s critical voters know just how devastating a second(ORDINAL) trump term would be for families across the country , ” said t.j . ducklo , a biden senior adviser for communications . 

“ the voters who will decide this election — the swing voters in the key battleground states , independents and the folks who particularly may not be paying as close attention right now because they ’re busy living their lives — those are the folks we ’re talking to , ” ducklo added . 

they are putting muscle into the effort on social media , where they share clips of trump talking about him welcoming the blame for killing the bipartisan border deal , defending himself for mixing up names and other verbal slipups , and saying rep . marjorie taylor(PERSON) greene(PERSON) ( r - ga . ) is “ respected by everybody . ” 

the idea that biden(PERSON) wants to run against trump and believes his best way to keeping the(ORG) white(ORG) house(ORG) is by demonizing the former president is not new . but with trump now the likely gop(ORG) nominee and ahead of biden in key polls , the anti - trump operation will only get more intense . 

biden(PERSON) led trump by nearly(CARDINAL) 10(CARDINAL) points with independents in 2020(DATE) , with 52(PERCENT) percent(PERCENT) of such voters supported biden(PERSON) , compared to 43(PERCENT) percent(PERCENT) backing trump(PERSON) , according to pew research center . 

strategists say elevating trump through the biden campaign is a way to recreate that . 

“ it can remind them of why they turned against trump in 2020(DATE) , ” said gop(ORG) strategist doug(PERSON) heye(PERSON) , referring to swing voters . “ it can have that affect for sure . that may be the bigger target actually than the base . ” 

the campaign has aggressively gone after trump(PERSON) ’s more controversial remarks , including saying recently that black voters were attracted to him because he faced criminal indictments and that he ’d serve as a dictator “ only on day one ” if reelected . 

“ today(DATE) ’s fractured media environment means everyone is getting their information from more places than ever – which is why it ’s our job to capture people ’s attention to alarming things trump says when he says them , ” ducklo said . 

highlighting these types of comments from the former president can attracts the press , who in turn can report on it so swing voters see it , backers say . 

“ it ’s always smart to be edgy or snarky by highlighting trump(PERSON) ’s nutty rhetoric . their stuff is definitely creative and clever , and i assume it grabs the attention of their intended audience — the press . when journalists and legacy media pick up and amplify their content , they can reach even more people , ” said michael(PERSON) larosa(PERSON) , former press secretary to first(ORDINAL) lady jill(PERSON) biden(PERSON) and special assistant to biden(PERSON) . 

heye said that part of the reason why the campaign lifts up trump ’s comments is that he is n’t dominating the media like he did in 2016(DATE) and 2020(DATE) . 

“ the biden(PERSON) campaign wants to , i think , make sure that on some of the more far - fetched or outrageous things that he says that the base or disaffected voters are reminded that they voted against the sequel to the to the movie one(CARDINAL) time and to try and push them to do it again , ” he said . 

meanwhile , there ’s no shortage of media attention on trump(PERSON) ’s legal troubles . 

his four(CARDINAL) criminal indictments are well - documented by the media , and his trials are consistently covered on television and in print media . 

the biden(ORG) campaign shares clips of trump when he ’s running for president , instead of when he ’s defendant trump sitting in courtrooms . 

“ we ’re focused on this election , not on donald(PERSON) trump(PERSON) ’s personal problems , ” ducklo said . “ what he says about immigrants ‘ poising the blood of our country , ’ about banning muslims(NORP) , imposing a national abortion ban , his refusal to protect ivf(ORG) — these affect people ’s lives . this election is not about what happens to donald(PERSON) trump(PERSON) . like all elections , it ’s about what happens to voters ’ lives . ” 

the effort to elevate trump ’s rhetoric comes as biden has struggled in polls with independent voters . trump(PERSON) outpaced biden(PERSON) by 11(CARDINAL) points with independent voters in a messenger / harris poll in january(DATE) . the former president garnered 46(PERCENT) percent(PERCENT) , biden(PERSON) got 35(PERCENT) percent(PERCENT) and(PERCENT) 20(PERCENT) percent(PERCENT) said they were undecided . 

independents nearly split their vote in 2016(DATE) , with 43(PERCENT) percent(PERCENT) supporting trump(PERSON) and 42(PERCENT) percent(PERCENT) supporting democratic(NORP) nominee hillary(PERSON) clinton(PERSON) . 

biden(PERSON) ’s lead over trump with the independent voting bloc in 2020(DATE) was essential to his success in winning back swing states clinton(PERSON) had lost . 

an alum of biden(ORG) ’s 2020(DATE) campaign said the team highlighting trump(PERSON) ’s remarks to attract swing voters is n’t a substitute for the president taking on trump ’s words himself , suggesting biden(PERSON) confront his rival head on . 

“ while the content creation and rapid response are supplemental components to communicating , the impact is far more consequential when voters and the media see or hear the candidate punching the other guy in the face , ” the source said . “ it ’s hard to land punches on trump with meaningful impact if biden is n’t the one confronting him . ”

nova - scotia - province - wide - universal - school - lunch - program : 

nova(ORG) scotia(ORG) is gearing up to launch a province - wide universal school lunch program as part of its recently announced 2024(DATE) -(DATE) 25(DATE) budget . 

on thursday(DATE) , nova(ORG) scotia(ORG) ’s(ORG) finance and treasury(ORG) board minister allan(PERSON) macmaster(PERSON) tabled the province ’s $(MONEY) 16.5(MONEY) billion(MONEY) plan — which included an $(MONEY) 18.8(MONEY) million(MONEY) investment toward developing a new lunch program for students in public schools . the initiative is expected to launch throughout the course of the(DATE) next(DATE) four(DATE) years(DATE) . 

becky(PERSON) druhan(PERSON) , the province ’s education minister , described the move as a “ historic step ” and said students will be granted access to affordable meals in every school once the program is fully implemented . 

“ we do need to phase our implementation to get it right . we ’re starting with a focus on elementary schools , ” she said , adding that the first(ORDINAL) part of the program ’s launch will occur when school returns in the(DATE) fall(DATE) . 

“ when it ’s completely rolled out , every student across the province will have access to universal school lunch . ” 

she said the school lunch program will be affordable for all families and free “ for those who need it . ” 

in addition , druhan(PERSON) mentioned on thursday(DATE) that the provincial government will collaborate with community groups and volunteer organizations that already providing similar services at schools in the province . 

“ existing school food programs , they are successful because of the involvement of volunteers , communities , donors , and of partners . those folks bring so much benefit beyond the provision of food , ” she said to reporters on thursday(DATE) . 

“ we want to make sure we leverage that … those relationships will continue to be incredibly important . ” 

‘ more needs to be done ’ 

lina(PERSON) hamid(PERSON) , a representative of the(ORG) united(ORG) way(ORG) , described the program proposal as a “ fantastic start ” but said she would like to see more initiatives brought forth to fill the void outside of school hours . 

“ there ’s a lot of food insecurity out there , ” she said . 

“ it might not always be visible , so having something in place for the children during the(DATE) school(DATE) year(DATE) is great . however , it does n’t address the(DATE) summer(DATE) months(DATE) ,(DATE) weekends(DATE) ,(DATE) holidays(DATE) , and everything in between(DATE) the(DATE) school(DATE) days(DATE) . ” 

although hamid(ORG) says the program is a step in the right direction , she noted that it does n’t offer a full - stop solution . she said the province needs to offer more financial support for families to prevent food insecurity altogether . 

“ for households to have the freedom and choice to prepare the meals they want … we know income support can do that . i think it ’s a fantastic program , a great first(ORDINAL) start , but there ’s a lot of food insecurity out there and more needs to be done to address it , ” she said . 

“ it ’s a pretty big deal . that ’s ( the lunch program ) something we should be very excited about , but we need to think about how we can further address food insecurity and take it a step further . ” 

according to data presented in a recent report from the canadian(NORP) centre for policy alternatives , nova(LOC) scotia(LOC) has the fourth(ORDINAL) - highest child poverty rate in the country and the highest in atlantic(LOC) canada(LOC) . 

the child poverty rate in nova(LOC) scotia rose to 20.5(MONEY) per(MONEY) cent(MONEY) in 2021(DATE) , representing more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) one(CARDINAL) in five(CARDINAL) children . 

wendie(PERSON) wilson(PERSON) , a community worker who works with food secure canada(GPE) , agreed the program is a good first(ORDINAL) step but said she ’d like to see politicians outside nova(LOC) scotia(LOC) get on board with the plan . 

“ would n’t it be fantastic if the federal government would be able to match that ? ” she asked , adding that she hopes businesses located near schools will receive an economic benefit once the program launches . 

“ i want to see dollars being spent in the community in order to build capacity , skills , and sustainability as well . ” 

although the program could provide some temporary relief , wilson(PERSON) said the bigger issue is investing in larger solutions to prevent child poverty and food insecurity altogether . 

“ food does not solve food insecurity , ” she said . 

“ getting a free lunch at school is n’t really solving the issue . the issue is really more around income . that ’s why i ’d like to see these dollars pull back into the community with those who are impacted the most by food insecurity . 

“ if we ’re able to shop locally … then what we ’re doing is increasing amongst those who are impacted the most . ” 

brendan(PERSON) maguire(PERSON) , a former liberal mla who recently joined tim(PERSON) houston(PERSON) ’s(PERSON) progressive conservatives and was appointed as minister of community service , applauded the inclusion of the universal school lunch program in the budget . 

“ a lot of us in that house have advocated for , for a long time , the lunch program . as a father of three(CARDINAL) , i know how much that will save me , ” he said . 

“ this is something that is going to save nova(ORG) scotians thousands(MONEY) of(MONEY) dollars(MONEY) a year . ”

former president donald(PERSON) trump(PERSON) made a particularly stunning claim at a get out the vote rally in greensboro(GPE) , nc(GPE) , saturday(DATE) , declaring that president joe(PERSON) biden(PERSON) was part of a “ conspiracy to overthrow the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) of(GPE) america(GPE) . ” 

after repeating false claims about the 2020(DATE) presidential race being a “ rigged election , ” trump got to the meat - and - potatoes portion of his speech : blaming joe(PERSON) biden(PERSON) for the border crisis . 

“ every day , joe(PERSON) biden(PERSON) is giving aid and comfort to the foreign enemies of the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) . he ’s actually giving aid , ” trump(PERSON) said , continuing :

trump(PERSON) ’s claim that biden(PERSON) is persecuting him as a political opponent stems from the doj ’s case to hold trump accountable for allegedly trying to block the peaceful transfer of power in 2020(DATE) . the former president faces felony charges of working to overturn the results of the 2020(DATE) presidential election and fomenting the jan(DATE) .(DATE) 6(DATE) riots at the u.s(GPE) .(GPE) capitol . 

immigration took center stage this(DATE) week(DATE) as both trump and biden(PERSON) visited different border towns in texas(GPE) . biden(PERSON) was criticized for choosing the town of brownsville(GPE) , which has seen far fewer migrants than eagle pass , where trump was joined by texas(GPE) gov . greg(PERSON) abbott(PERSON) ( r(GPE) -(GPE) tx(GPE) ) .

13601(CARDINAL) : 

new belgian(NORP) international branding campaign highlights openness to innovation 

the new belgian(NORP) international branding campaign centres around “ embracing openness ” . primarily targeted at economic decision makers and the broader research community , the initiative has been launched by the fps chancellery of the prime minister to strengthen belgium(GPE) ’s openness for innovation , as supported by partnerships and diversity . the campaign will run until april(DATE) 2026(DATE) . 

belgium(GPE) is open to innovation , partnerships , and diversity 

a strategic survey conducted by the fps foreign affairs , foreign trade and development cooperation in 2022(DATE) revealed that belgium(GPE) is generally held in high regard by the international community . opinion leaders from around the world expressed their positive perception of belgium(GPE) as a country , highlighting its open - mindedness , innovative spirit , willingness to collaborate , and commitment to the rule of law and human rights . 

the survey further indicated that belgium(GPE) has a favourable reputation among researchers , opinion leaders , investors , and ngos . however , it was found that the country lacks sufficient visibility and often displays excessive modesty . 

these survey findings have served as the basis for belgium(GPE) 's new country branding strategy , along with an accompanying campaign that emphasizes belgium(GPE) 's commitment to innovation , partnership , and diversity , encapsulated in the baseline " embracing openness " . 

belgium(GPE) 's commitment to openness for innovation in difficult times 

“ whether it is the production of covid vaccines , pioneering biotech and semiconductor research , or our leading role in offshore energy , belgium(GPE) has consistently shown that openness for innovation is vital for a successful society . embracing partnerships and diversity is an integral part of this . by collaborating across different perspectives , building bridges , and forging alliances , we can make substantial progress both economically and socially . this approach is an essential part of belgium(GPE) ’s dna . while others might choose to isolate themselves , belgium(GPE) radically choses for openness as the way forward . ” – belgian(NORP) prime minister alexander(PERSON) de(PERSON) croo(PERSON) , announcing the launch of the " embracing openness " campaign . 

embracing innovation – to tackle tomorrow(DATE) ’s challenges 

to meet challenges such as climate change , european(NORP) strategic autonomy and security of energy supplies , the campaign will showcase belgium(GPE) ’s innovative side . 

with a proven track record in technological and scientific excellence , belgium(GPE) is a bustling hub of innovation . notable belgian(NORP) achievements include leading the charge in biopharma r&d , nanoelectronics , and offshore energy combined with world - class research institutions and universities . 

belgium(GPE) is driving the high - tech chip revolution through collaboration between its imec laboratories and ku(PERSON) leuven(PERSON) , named the seventh(ORDINAL) most innovative university in the world by reuters(ORG) . in addition , thanks to research from ghent(ORG) university(ORG) , ulb & vub(GPE) , belgium(GPE) is leading the way on medical discoveries on life - altering conditions including cancer , alzheimer ’s , and aids . 

as for the energy transition , belgium(GPE) has co - founded the north(LOC) sea(LOC) coalition to create the largest source of renewable energy in europe(LOC) , aiming to quadruple combined offshore wind capacity to 65(QUANTITY) gigawatts(QUANTITY) by 2030(DATE) and to at(QUANTITY) least(QUANTITY) 150(QUANTITY) gigawatts(QUANTITY) by 2050(DATE) . 

driving progress and innovation with the support of partnerships 

the campaign will also show how innovation and sustainable solutions for the public good are made possible through partnerships . because no single entity can tackle complex problems and fully capitalize on opportunities alone . 

this sense of cooperation is ingrained in belgium(GPE) 's dna . it is no coincidence that belgium(GPE) , a founding member of both the(ORG) united(ORG) nations(ORG) , nato(ORG) and the(ORG) european(ORG) union(ORG) , hosts key european(NORP) and international organisations . belgium(GPE) will place a special emphasis on promoting partnerships for innovation during its upcoming 2024(DATE) presidency of the(ORG) council(ORG) of(ORG) the(ORG) eu(ORG) . 

fostering prosperous innovation with diversity at heart 

more than ever , belgium(GPE) fosters its belief in the virtues of an open , tolerant , and inclusive society to boost innovation and ensure progress and prosperity for all . 

“ embracing openness ” will show that belgium(GPE) is a shared home of many communities and cultures with diversity at its heart – as evidenced by its ranking in second(ORDINAL) place in the rainbow index , its third(ORDINAL) place in the kof globalisation index , as well as its participation in the global shedecides movement and its co - supervisory role in the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination . 

a multi - channel campaign telling belgium(GPE) ’s story 

as a nation , belgium(GPE) is not known for heavily promoting its achievements . as the campaign helps to address this , it has invited people from other countries to share their feelings on why belgium(GPE) is great ; perspectives captured in the new campaign baseline : “ we do n’t say belgium(GPE) is great , others do ” . 

the campaign is based on people from other countries who will talk about their experiences with belgium(GPE) and belgians(ORG) in their own language . with stories that focus on the three(CARDINAL) pillars of the campaign : innovation , partnerships , and diversity . this mix is precisely what makes belgium(GPE) unique . 

through digital channels and stakeholder activation events , the new campaign aims to enhance belgium(GPE) 's global presence , attract investors and researchers , and showcase its prominent industries , all while upholding fundamental belgian(NORP) values . 

the " embracing openness " campaign ’s goal is to contribute positively to the reputation of belgium(GPE) on the international stage . the campaign will also be promoted through belgian(NORP) embassies and diplomatic posts across the world . 

the new belgian(NORP) country branding will be visible at brussels(FAC) airport(FAC) , extending a warm welcome to international travellers , professionals , and innovation partners . the twentieth(ORDINAL) anniversary of the legalization of same - sex marriage in belgium(GPE) in june(DATE) was one(CARDINAL) of the campaign ’s first(ORDINAL) milestones . 

in the(DATE) coming(DATE) years(DATE) , additional campaign moments will align with trade missions , international conferences , and stakeholder events . with a global perspective , the campaign will initially concentrate on europe(LOC) , preparing for belgium(GPE) 's upcoming presidency of the(ORG) council(ORG) of(ORG) the(ORG) european(ORG) union(ORG) , starting in 2024(DATE) .

rep(PERSON) -(PERSON) harriet(PERSON) -(PERSON) hageman(PERSON) -(PERSON) hunter(PERSON) -(PERSON) biden(PERSON) - used - addictions - as - a - sword - and - a - shield : 

wyoming(ORG) republican(ORG) rep(ORG) . harriet(PERSON) hageman(PERSON) , who sits on the(ORG) house(ORG) judiciary(ORG) committee(ORG) , told the federalist in an exclusive interview after hunter(PERSON) biden(PERSON) ’s testimony this(DATE) week(DATE) that the president ’s son used addiction to escape difficult questions . 

whenever biden(PERSON) received tough questions , hageman described the response as “ i do n’t know , i do n’t remember , because i was addicted at that time . ” one(CARDINAL) prominent example came when biden could not recall a meeting between his father and chinese(NORP) business leaders . biden(PERSON) also played ignorant about the “ exact amount ” the family received from chinese(NORP) companies while claiming every gift and transaction was “ completely legal ” and “ incredibly ethical . ” 

“ he was extremely well prepared , ” hageman(ORG) said of biden(PERSON) , who testified in a closed - door deposition wednesday(DATE) . “ his attorneys had spent probably days(DATE) and days and days with him to make sure he had his story down very well . ” 

“ yet when we tried to get into details , ” hageman added , he mostly said , “ ‘ well , i do n’t have a memory of that . ' ” biden(PERSON) ’s attorneys were also “ incredibly aggressive at trying to deflect difficult questions . ” 

hageman pressed biden(PERSON) on his qualifications to handle multimillion(MONEY) -(MONEY) dollar(MONEY) deals with international business partners , considering his problems with addiction . 

“ in terms of what we have seen with some of the photographs , the information from the laptop , the information from your book , i would say that i do n’t believe that that represents someone who would be responsible and considered a professional , ” hageman(ORG) said in her wednesday(DATE) questioning . biden(PERSON) responded with what hageman characterized in her interview with the federalist as “ shockingly arrogant . ” 

“ there are a lot of people around this room who suffer from alcoholism that are still in this room and that they ’re still functioning , ” biden(PERSON) said . 

hageman(ORG) asked whether biden(PERSON) informed associates about his substance abuse . 

“ it was fairly obvious i had a problem , ” biden(PERSON) responded . 

hageman(ORG) said the testimony corroborated what was already obvious to lawmakers , which was that “ all of those board positions that he had all came back to the fact that his last name is ‘ biden , ' ” because the younger biden did n’t have anything to offer “ other than the access to his father . ” 

in wednesday(DATE) ’s deposition , hunter(PERSON) biden(PERSON) confirmed such access to his father , which other witnesses have already testified to before lawmakers . 

[ related : 8(CARDINAL) unbelievable claims from hunter(PERSON) biden(PERSON) ’s congressional deposition ] 

on a trip to california(GPE) , hunter(PERSON) biden(PERSON) conceded his father had coffee at a hotel with tony(PERSON) bobuslinki(PERSON) , a business partner - turned whistleblower who accused the president of being “ compromised ” by the(ORG) chinese(ORG) communist(ORG) party(ORG) . 

“ he met him in the lobby of the hotel , ” hunter(PERSON) biden(PERSON) said , according to the transcript of the interview released thursday(DATE) . 

bobulinski(ORG) told lawmakers earlier in february(DATE) that joe(PERSON) biden(PERSON) was “ the brand ” his family sold to foreign adversaries as the former vice president prepared another run for the(ORG) white(ORG) house(ORG) . 

“ [ biden(PERSON) ’s ] family ’s foreign influence peddling operation — from china(GPE) to ukraine(GPE) and elsewhere — sold out to foreign actors who were seeking to gain influence and access to joe(PERSON) biden(PERSON) and the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) government , ” bobulisnki(GPE) said . “ joe(PERSON) biden(PERSON) was more than a participant in and beneficiary of his family ’s business , he was an enabler , despite being buffered by a complex scheme to maintain plausible deniability . ” 

on wednesday(DATE) , hunter(PERSON) biden(PERSON) also confirmed that he repeatedly put his father on speakerphone when in the company of clients . last(DATE) summer(DATE) , former family business partner devon(PERSON) archer(PERSON) testified hunter(PERSON) biden(PERSON) put foreign businessmen and potential investors on speakerphone with joe(PERSON) biden(PERSON) at(CARDINAL) least(CARDINAL) two(CARDINAL) dozen(CARDINAL) times . 

“ yes , that probably did happen , ” hunter(PERSON) biden(PERSON) said . “ i always answer his call , based upon my life ’s experience . ” 

house(ORG) republicans(NORP) interviewed the president ’s son as part of an impeachment inquiry after investigators found the bidens funneling millions(CARDINAL) between more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 20(CARDINAL) shell companies . most were set up when joe(PERSON) biden(PERSON) was vice president . 

hunter(PERSON) biden(PERSON) ’s testimony not only corroborates previous witnesses but also contradicts his father ’s vehement denials from the presidential campaign trail . joe(PERSON) biden(PERSON) repeatedly claimed prior to the oval office that he never spoke business with his son , “ or with anyone else , ” and even fat - shamed an iowa(GPE) voter who approached the subject in 2019(DATE) . at a december(DATE) town hall , the voter pressed the former vice president about hunter(PERSON) biden(PERSON) ’s lucrative position on the board of burisma , a ukrainian(NORP) energy company , despite no prior experience in the industry . 

“ you ’re a damn liar , man , ” joe(PERSON) biden(PERSON) said , and went on to challenge the voter to push - ups .

we - are - with - you - mourners - chant - navalnys - name - as - kremlin - critic - is - laid - to - rest - a84312 : 

thousands(CARDINAL) of mourners gathered in moscow(GPE) on friday(DATE) to say goodbye to the late opposition figure alexei navalny , the kremlin(ORG) ’s most prominent critic . 

“ i glanced back and found myself unable to see where the crowd ended — it seemed to stretch on forever , ” said vadim(ORG) , who attended the funeral ceremony . 

despite the risk of detention , official warnings and a heavy police presence , thousands(CARDINAL) of navalny ’s supporters gathered at the russian(NORP) orthodox church and nearby cemetery in southeastern moscow(GPE) where his funeral was held to honor his legacy . 

“ i came today(DATE) to see for the last time a man like no other in this country , and in the whole world , ” said nadezhda , 69(DATE) , who was standing at the church ’s entrance with a large bouquet of roses . 

a former volunteer at navalny ’s anti - corruption foundation , nadezhda remembers how navalny ’s blog first(ORDINAL) sparked her interest in politics over a(DATE) decade(DATE) ago(DATE) . 

“ for me personally , he was the hope for a different life in this country , ” she said with tears in her eyes . “ we became orphans [ when he died ] . ” 

with navalny ’s team and thousands(CARDINAL) of his supporters in exile due to a sweeping political crackdown , holding a funeral for president vladimir(PERSON) putin(PERSON) ’s adversary was always going to be fraught with risk . 

following his death on feb(DATE) .(DATE) 16(DATE) , hundreds(CARDINAL) of mourners across the country were detained while laying flowers at makeshift memorials . 

ahead of friday(DATE) ’s funeral , kremlin(ORG) spokesman dmitry(PERSON) peskov(PERSON) warned that any unauthorized demonstration in navalny ’s support would be considered a violation of the law and that participants would be held accountable . 

the mood in the kremlin(ORG) has been one of anxiety in recent(DATE) weeks(DATE) despite putin(PERSON) ’s near - guaranteed re - election this(DATE) month(DATE) , two(CARDINAL) high - ranking sources in the russian(NORP) government who spoke on condition of anonymity told the moscow(GPE) times . 

following navalny ’s death , the kremlin(ORG) held a series of meetings with senior fsb and interior ministry generals to plan how to prevent the funeral from capturing the public ’s attention , the two(CARDINAL) sources said . 

“ the kremlin(ORG) does not want a picture similar to the rally at [ soviet(NORP) dissident andrei(PERSON) ] sakharov(ORG) 's funeral . therefore , the special services are working according to their plan , ” a russian(NORP) official who formerly worked for a security agency said . 

state media was also ordered to ignore the funeral , a source close to the kremlin(ORG) and the manager of a major russian(NORP) media outlet said . 

starting early(TIME) in(TIME) the(TIME) morning(TIME) , the area surrounding the church was under heavy surveillance by law enforcement . several police vans were parked next to the church as riot police cordoned off the church ’s entrance . 

moscow(GPE) times reporters in the area reported widespread disruptions with cellular and mobile internet service which appeared to be linked to special antennas installed thursday(DATE) . masked agents in civilian clothes were seen monitoring the crowd . 

“ i 'm afraid , of course , but despite the fear , a man died in prison and we are here , ” said maxim , a 37(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) -(DATE) old(DATE) doctor . 

“ it ’s the least we can do , ” he continued . 

maxim said he used to believe navalny was a puppet manipulated by the russian(NORP) authorities . but navalny ’s 2021(DATE) return to russia(GPE) after recovering from a near - fatal poisoning — despite the certainty of being jailed — changed his mind . 

“ that was the best demonstration that this person was actually doing something right and important , ” he said . 

inside the church of the icon of the mother of god soothe my sorrows , a small crowd of mourners surrounded navalny ’s casket . a choir sang as the priest performed the traditional orthodox memorial service . 

lyudmila(ORG) , navalny ’s mother , sat near the casket , holding a candle and staring at her son . 

among the mourners was a young woman holding a portrait of navalny in a gold frame and a book titled “ the saint vs. the reich(PERSON) , ” the story of a german(NORP) orthodox student who resisted the nazis . 

a few masked men , likely law enforcement agents in civilian clothes , observed the scene . 

navalny , 47(DATE) , died on feb(DATE) .(DATE) 16(DATE) in the “ polar wolf ” penal colony in the arctic(LOC) where he was serving a 19(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) sentence on extremism charges that were widely deemed politically motivated . 

his close associates and wife yulia navalnaya(PERSON) have publicly accused the kremlin(ORG) of being behind the politician 's murder . 

foreign diplomats , including the french(NORP) , german(NORP) and u.s(GPE) .(GPE) ambassadors , attended navalny ’s funeral . anti - war presidential hopeful boris(PERSON) nadezhdin and former yekaterinburg(GPE) opposition mayor yevgeny(PERSON) roizman(PERSON) were also present . 

“ people like him are born once in a(DATE) hundred(DATE) years(DATE) , ” says alexander(PERSON) , 69(DATE) , a russian(NORP) literature teacher , of navalny . “ with such a strong soul , they are sent by god . ” 

when the black hearse with navalny ’s body finally arrived at the church at around(TIME) 2(TIME) p.m.(TIME) , the crowd started clapping and chanting navalny ’s name . 

“ navalny is alive ! ” someone shouted . 

the police then started allowing people into the church in small groups through metal detectors . a masked officer at the entrance filmed people as they entered . 

outside the church , people chanted slogans like “ lyosha , we are with you , ” " freedom for political prisoners , " " russia(GPE) will be free , " and " russia(GPE) without putin(PERSON) . " 

as the ceremony ended , the casket was immediately covered and carried away despite people ’s protests . 

“ let us say goodbye ! ” they shouted . 

“ i ’ve never seen something like this , ” one(CARDINAL) of the mourners said . “ they killed a man and do n’t even let people say goodbye — that ’s real satanism , ” he said , referring to the russian(NORP) authorities . 

“ they even violate god ’s laws , ” a woman next to him said . 

navalny ’s allies accused the kremlin(ORG) of thwarting their plans to hold a separate civic ceremony in a larger venue that could have accommodated more people . 

the funeral was initially planned for thursday(DATE) , but navalny ally ivan(PERSON) zhdanov claimed that every funeral home in moscow(GPE) had refused because of putin(PERSON) ’s address to the russian(NORP) parliament that(DATE) day(DATE) . 

navalny(ORG) ’s(ORG) spokeswoman kira(PERSON) yarmysh(PERSON) said the russian(NORP) capital ’s funeral services received threats from unknown individuals not to transport navalny ’s body to the church . 

as the ceremony ended and navalny ’s body was carried from the church , thousands(CARDINAL) of people continued to chant navalny ’s name and “ we wo n’t forgive ! ” 

mourners outside the church tossed flowers at the hearse carrying navalny 's coffin as it departed for the cemetery . 

“ thank you , ” a voice in the crowd shouted . 

as navalny ’s mother paid her last farewell to her son before his burial , the funeral orchestra played frank(PERSON) sinatra(PERSON) ’s “ my way . ” 

it was followed by the final theme from “ terminator 2 ” — which navalny considered “ the best film in the world , ” according to yarmysh . 

“ after the death of alexei navalny , i lost hope [ for a better future ] for some time . but as navalny said , we should not give up , ” one(CARDINAL) muscovite said . 

“ this should be the motto we must live with in modern russia(GPE) — hope never dies . ”

trump - wins - michigan(GPE) - missouri(GPE) - republican(NORP) - caucuses - in - dominant - show - of - force : 

grand rapids , michigan(GPE) - former united(GPE) states(GPE) president donald(PERSON) trump(PERSON) on march(DATE) 2(DATE) easily won the republican(NORP) caucuses in michigan(GPE) , where his party has been riven by infighting that some republicans(NORP) fear could hurt his campaign in the key battleground state as he gears up for the election in november(DATE) . 

trump(PERSON) also won the missouri(GPE) and idaho(GPE) republican caucus on march(DATE) 2(DATE) , according to edison(ORG) research(ORG) . 

in all three(CARDINAL) states , trump(PERSON) trounced mrs nikki(PERSON) haley(PERSON) , his last remaining rival for the republican(NORP) presidential nomination , moving him closer to becoming his party ’s white(ORG) house(ORG) standard - bearer and a likely general election rematch with president joe(PERSON) biden(PERSON) , a democrat(NORP) . 

in michigan(GPE) , trump(PERSON) beat mrs(PERSON) haley(PERSON) in all 13(CARDINAL) districts taking part in the nominating caucuses , according to the(ORG) state(ORG) republican(ORG) party(ORG) . 

overall , trump(PERSON) won with nearly(MONEY) 98(MONEY) per(MONEY) cent(MONEY) support : 1,575(CARDINAL) votes to just(CARDINAL) 36(CARDINAL) votes for mrs(PERSON) haley(PERSON) . 

the(ORG) michigan(ORG) republican(ORG) party(ORG) ’s(ORG) chair pete(PERSON) hoekstra(PERSON) called it “ an overwhelming , dominating victory ” . 

more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 1,600(CARDINAL) party insiders participated in the presidential caucus in the western michigan city of grand rapids , where they were choosing delegates for trump or former united nations ambassador haley(PERSON) for the party ’s national nominating convention in july(DATE) . 

mrs(PERSON) haley(PERSON) is fast running out of time to alter the course of the republican(NORP) nominating race . next up is super tuesday(DATE) on march(DATE) 5(DATE) , the(DATE) biggest(DATE) day(DATE) in the primaries , when 15(CARDINAL) states and one(CARDINAL) territory will vote . 

with victories in iowa(GPE) , new(GPE) hampshire(GPE) , nevada(GPE) , the(ORG) us(ORG) virgin(ORG) islands(ORG) , south(GPE) carolina(GPE) , and now michigan(GPE) , missouri(GPE) and idaho(GPE) under his belt , trump is far and away the front runner in the race , with mrs(PERSON) haley(PERSON) hanging on , thanks to support from donors keen on an alternative to the former president . 

for this election cycle , michigan(GPE) republicans(NORP) devised a hybrid nominating system , split between a primary and a caucus . 

trump(PERSON) won the primary convincingly on feb(DATE) 27(DATE) , securing 12(CARDINAL) of 16(CARDINAL) delegates up for grabs . he took all of michigan(GPE) ’s remaining 39(CARDINAL) delegates at stake on march(DATE) 2(DATE) . 

at one(CARDINAL) of the 13(CARDINAL) caucus meetings , the participants – knowing trump would win easily – decided to save time by simply asking anyone who backed mrs(PERSON) haley(PERSON) to stand up . in a room of 185(CARDINAL) voting delegates , 25(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) -(DATE) old(DATE) carter(PERSON) houtman(PERSON) was the only person who rose to his feet . 

“ it was a little lonely , ” he told reuters(ORG) in an interview afterwards . 

mr houtman(PERSON) said he would likely vote for trump in november(DATE) ’s general election if he is the nominee , but felt it was important to stand up for his beliefs on march(DATE) 2(DATE) . 

“ i did n’t like the way that trump handled himself after the last election , ” mr houtman(PERSON) said . 

mr dennis(PERSON) milosch(PERSON) , 87(DATE) , a trump supporter , said the former president ’s dominating win on march(DATE) 2(DATE) underscored how the party has been transformed from one aligned with big business to one focused on the working class . 

“ wherever he goes , whatever he does , he pays attention to , responds to , the average person , ” mr milosch(PERSON) said . 

the contest in michigan(GPE) on march(DATE) 2(DATE) had held the potential for confusion . internal turmoil has been percolating in the party for months(DATE) , pitting backers of michigan(GPE) ’s former republican(ORG) party(ORG) chair , ms(PERSON) kristina(PERSON) karamo(PERSON) , against a faction of party members who voted to oust her on jan(DATE) 6(DATE) , and installed mr hoekstra(ORG) as chair . 

mr hoekstra(ORG) , whom trump(PERSON) backed as chair , was overseeing the convention in grand rapids . ms(PERSON) karamo(PERSON) had been planning to chair a duelling convention in detroit(GPE) on march(DATE) 2(DATE) , but that was cancelled after a michigan(GPE) court this(DATE) week(DATE) affirmed her ouster and an appeals court denied her request to stay the ruling . 

pro - karamo party chairs for at(CARDINAL) least(CARDINAL) two(CARDINAL) districts held caucus meetings in separate locations from grand rapids in protest . however , the results from those are unlikely to be accepted by the(ORG) republican(ORG) national(ORG) committee(ORG) , which in february(DATE) formally recognised mr hoekstra(ORG) as state party chair . 

mr hoekstra(ORG) was the us(GPE) ambassador to the netherlands(GPE) during trump(GPE) ’s presidency . speaking to reuters on the sidelines of the caucus meetings , he said he was confident the(ORG) michigan(ORG) republican(ORG) party(ORG) would unite around the objectives of winning the(ORG) white(ORG) house(ORG) and a us(GPE) senate(ORG) seat up for grabs , and retaking the state house of representatives . 

“ there is not a philosophical divide nor an issue divide , ” mr hoekstra(ORG) said . “ this is about getting the party ready to win in november(DATE) ... the focus is on beating joe(PERSON) biden(PERSON) . ” 

trump(PERSON) ’s victories in missouri(GPE) and idaho(GPE) netted him 54(CARDINAL) and 32(CARDINAL) delegates , respectively . reuters(ORG)

28891(CARDINAL) : 

oleksandr(PERSON) kamyshin(PERSON) , the minister of strategic industries , stated in an interview with the independent media outlet that amidst a brutal artillery war with russia(GPE) , ukraine(GPE) requires an amount of ammunition that “ no single country can deliver . ” 

he said that even the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) could n’t deliver the needed ammunition . 

as the war entered its(DATE) third(DATE) year(DATE) , ukraine(GPE) ramped up cost - effective methods to bolster its defenses and significantly increased domestic production , with a threefold(CARDINAL) surge in 2023(DATE) and plans for a sixfold boost this(DATE) year(DATE) . 

ukraine(GPE) ’s defense minister , rustem(PERSON) umerov(PERSON) , disclosed over the(DATE) weekend(DATE) that half(CARDINAL) of the pledged military aid from western allies is arriving late , “ costing lives and territory . ” 

ukraine(GPE) has received only(CARDINAL) a(CARDINAL) third(CARDINAL) of the one(CARDINAL) million(CARDINAL) artillery shells the(ORG) european(ORG) union(ORG) had committed to delivering by march(DATE) of(DATE) last(DATE) year(DATE) . 

president volodymyr(PERSON) zelensky(PERSON) recently acknowledged that daily(DATE) , russian(NORP) forces unleash an average of seven(CARDINAL) times more munitions on ukrainian(NORP) troops than they can retaliate with . recent reports suggest that ukraine(GPE) has been forced to limit its forces to firing just(CARDINAL) 2,000(CARDINAL) artillery rounds per day . 

“ capable of making more , but do n’t have the funding for it . ” 

“ our defense industry capabilities are several times larger than the funding available to support it , so right now , we have to cherry - pick , ” kamyshin(PERSON) told the independent . “ we are capable of making more , but we do n’t have the funding for it . " 

hur(ORG) carried out strike on largest oil refinery in russia(GPE) ’s kaluga(GPE) region(GPE) 

he revealed that ukraine(GPE) prioritizes ammunition , then drones , and then air defense with the available funds , adding , “ the rest suffers . ” 

kamyshin(PERSON) added that it could be something that the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) and other partners could cover , mentioning that the ukrainian(NORP) authorities are asking the uk and the us(GPE) for funding . 

the minister acknowledged that regardless of ukraine(GPE) 's domestic production , it will continue to depend on external supply due to the intensity of the battlefield . 

however , advancing new technologies , such as fpv(ORG) drones and long - range drones striking deep into russian(NORP) territory , significantly contribute to this effort and could potentially lead to achieving air superiority “ for the first(ORDINAL) time . ” 

in terms of support , he emphasized the importance of financing , stating , “ it is in the interest of our partners like the us(GPE) and the uk(GPE) to fund our industry – and let us produce more to win the war . ” 

ukraine(GPE) is becoming a global pioneer in unmanned systems 

kamyshin(PERSON) disclosed that ukraine(GPE) is positioning itself as a global leader in drone technology , with unmanned aerial vehicles ( uavs ) emerging as a crucial element in ukraine(GPE) 's modern battlefields . 

the significance of drones is so pronounced that zelensky(PERSON) declared the establishment of a distinct military branch , the unmanned systems force , focused on uavs(ORG) and their technologies , the independence highlighted . 

“ domestic production is crucial , ” kamyshin(PERSON) reported . 

he stated that ukraine(GPE) can produce over one(CARDINAL) million(CARDINAL) first - person - view ( fpv(ORG) ) drones this(DATE) year(DATE) , along with thousands(CARDINAL) of drones capable of flying over(QUANTITY) 1,000(QUANTITY) km(QUANTITY) , reaching as far as refineries in russia(GPE) , stressing , “ this is a game - changer . ” 

“ our defense tech is really cool , and together with the newly formed force of unmanned drone systems , it will deliver results , ” kamyshin(PERSON) said . 

the minister said that ukraine(GPE) is on track to become a global pioneer in unmanned systems : “ we have technology we can share : our naval and flying drones are already better and cheaper than any other country . ” 

additionally , kamyshin(PERSON) told the independent that those products could be available for partners to strengthen joint defense capabilities . 

he said that ukraine(GPE) possesses rapid capabilities in developing these new technologies , actively testing prototypes on the battlefield in real time . 

kamyshin(PERSON) had previously addressed the capabilities of the ukrainian(NORP) defense complex on dec(DATE) .(DATE) 27(DATE) ,(DATE) 2022(DATE) , saying that they were about twice as large as the available funding . 

“ therefore , together with the team of the(ORG) ministry(ORG) of(ORG) defense(ORG) , the(ORG) ministry(ORG) of(ORG) finance(ORG) , the prime minister , and the president , we are working on finding additional funding for this sector , ” he said . 

kamyshin(PERSON) also said that weapon production in ukraine(GPE) began only in recent(DATE) years(DATE) as a response to russia(GPE) 's full - scale invasion in 2022(DATE) , focusing on artillery shells , drones , armored personnel carriers , and other military equipment . " 

currently , the defense industry employs 300,000(CARDINAL) workers and comprises 500(CARDINAL) enterprises , with 400(CARDINAL) privately owned .

ukraine(GPE) has $(MONEY) 40(MONEY) billion(MONEY) in reserves in international banks . it is flush with 🤑 . there is no funding problem . why is zelensky(PERSON) not buying ammunition ? this ammunition shortage is a scam . 

@miranda(WORK_OF_ART) , ouch . that is getting scary low . 

you are absolutely right that its time to for ukraine(GPE) 's allies to ramp up investments and weapons supply to ukraine(GPE) . this is there existential fight too as a russian(NORP) win in ukraine(GPE) would only leave that despot more assets to use against democracies . 

for frontline battles the artillery & shorter range ammunition deficit is causing immediate loss of offensive momentum and risking precious ukraine(NORP) soldier lives . 

what would be great is if germany(GPE) and the usa will follow the uk(GPE) and france(GPE) 's lead and give the ukrainian(NORP) 's the requested longer range missiles . the fight needs to be taken deep inside russia(GPE) . its ' in keeping with international war rules that the victim nation is allowed to attack the aggressor nation within its borders . 

hopefully the f16s will also be useful for this . we need to send something that will help putin(PERSON) with his itchy colon and it perches upon his moscow(GPE) bunker toilet . it 's just not right to leave a tormented man in such torment . i think he 'd appreciate at this point , being on the receiving end of some long range bunker buster missiles .

ambush is a strong word but it may be one that ’s fitting here , ” jackson(GPE) county(GPE) prosecuting attorney jean(PERSON) peters(PERSON) baker said at a news conference . 

evictions have turned deadly in the past . in august(DATE) 2022(DATE) , an arizona(GPE) constable who got the job when her predecessor quit over frustration about serving eviction notices was shot and killed while carrying out that same duty . the gunman , his neighbor and the manager of his apartment complex also died , authorities said .

in missouri(GPE) , jackson(GPE) county(GPE) presiding judge jalilah(PERSON) otto(PERSON) said that because mack(PERSON) was an employee of the court , the case will be moved to another county chosen by the(ORG) missouri(ORG) supreme(ORG) court(ORG) . mack(PERSON) , who was in his(DATE) early(DATE) 40s(DATE) , had worked for jackson(GPE) county(GPE) for over a decade . 

bond in the case is set at $(MONEY) 2(MONEY) million(MONEY) . baker(PERSON) said acree , who sustained minor injuries , remains hospitalized and will be moved to the jail as soon as he is able . 

no attorney is listed for acree in online court records . acree(PERSON) ’s brother , bill(PERSON) acree(PERSON) jr(PERSON) .(PERSON) , said he did n’t know of the charges or the shooting when reached by the associated press . he said he has n’t seen larry(PERSON) acree(PERSON) for 17(DATE) years(DATE) , and they have n’t been close for a long time . 

on feb(DATE) .(DATE) 23(DATE) , a “ notice to vacate ” sign was posted at the property , according to the probable cause affidavit . it stemmed from court actions that began one(DATE) year(DATE) earlier(DATE) . acree(PERSON) “ did n't have any right to be there , " baker said . 

on thursday(DATE) , mack(PERSON) and another process server arrived at the address to physically evict acree . a padlock was removed from the gated drive , and the two(CARDINAL) process servers approached the front of the home , where they knocked and announced their presence . 

no one answered , so the property maintenance contractor drilled out the lock on the front door , the statement said . they then entered the home and were fired upon . mack(PERSON) was struck and fell to the floor just inside the front door , court records said . 

the other process server ran and sought help , court records said . independence police then rushed to the home , where three(CARDINAL) officers entered and tried to retrieve mack(PERSON) . they then came under additional gunfire , court records said . 

officer cody(PERSON) allen(PERSON) , a 35(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) -(DATE) old(DATE) father of two(CARDINAL) young children , was shot in the head , and a second(ORDINAL) officer was shot in the torso , court records said . 

officers then returned fire , and the suspect was taken into custody . the wounded were taken to nearby centerpoint medical hospital , where mack(PERSON) and allen(PERSON) were pronounced dead . 

the officer struck in the torso underwent surgery and is expected to survive . that officer also sustained additional injuries to the arms and face . 

police chief adam(PERSON) dustman(PERSON) said previously that a third(ORDINAL) officer also “ took gunshot rounds ” and had minor injuries . no charges were immediately filed stemming from that officer 's injuries . 

baker(PERSON) said more charges were coming but that they just were n't prepared yet . she declined to release details on the type of firearm or firearms used . 

a memorial of flowers and flags was growing friday(DATE) at the(ORG) independence(ORG) police(ORG) department(ORG) . 

dustman(ORG) said allen(PERSON) took a break from policing to work in the private sector but missed it so much that he rejoined the department about(DATE) two(DATE) years(DATE) ago(DATE) . the(ORG) grandview(ORG) police(ORG) department(ORG) , where allen(PERSON) also once worked , described his death as “ a huge loss . ” 

meanwhile , otto described mack(PERSON) , a father who was engaged to be married , as “ beloved by many . ” 

the home where the eviction notice was being served had been sold recently and had delinquent taxes dating to at(DATE) least(DATE) 2019(DATE) , records show . 

jackson(GPE) county(GPE) property records show acree(PRODUCT) bought the 9(QUANTITY) -(QUANTITY) acre(QUANTITY) property in 2005(DATE) and then built the three(CARDINAL) - bedroom , 2,419(QUANTITY) -(QUANTITY) square(QUANTITY) -(QUANTITY) foot(QUANTITY) home . 

but he had a history of financial problems , including bankruptcies in 1992(DATE) and 2004(DATE) . and the 69(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) -(DATE) old(DATE) was ordered to pay a roofing company , with $ 32,155(MONEY) due as of aug(DATE) .(DATE) 1(DATE) , according to court records . 

records from later(DATE) that(DATE) month(DATE) in the roofing case signaled that a sale was in the works . the sale was completed on aug(DATE) .(DATE) 14(DATE) for $ 260,000(MONEY) , and the new owner paid the back taxes . 

the person who bought the property did n’t immediately respond to a facebook message from the ap seeking comment . 

independence is a suburb of kansas(GPE) city(GPE) , with about(CARDINAL) 122,000(CARDINAL) residents .

“ our region has been weighted with it seems one(CARDINAL) tragedy after another after another , ” she said . “ almost every one of those is linked to someone using firearms in a way that they ’re not supposed to . i do acknowledge that this community is suffering . it ’s a lot for one(CARDINAL) community to bear . ”

george-galloway-rochdale-labour-byelection-b2505228.html(PERSON) : 

rishi(PERSON) sunak(PERSON) warns british(NORP) democracy being targeted by far - right and islamists 

prime minister responds to ‘ beyond alarming ’ rochdale by - election result that saw george(PERSON) galloway(PERSON) win shock return to westminster 

rishi(PERSON) sunak(PERSON) has said democracy is under attack from far - right and islamist(NORP) extremists as he urged the country to unite to beat the “ poison ” . 

in an extraordinary move , the prime minister used a hastily arranged press conference outside no 10 yesterday(DATE) to announce a new crackdown on extremism and appeal to the public to face down those he said were “ trying to tear us apart ” . 

just(TIME) hours(TIME) after george(PERSON) galloway(PERSON) ’s victory in the rochdale by - election , he said it was “ beyond alarming ” voters had backed a candidate who “ dismisses the horror of what happened on october(DATE) 7(DATE) ” , when hamas(ORG) murdered 1,200(CARDINAL) people in israel(GPE) . 

earlier , the board of deputies of british(NORP) jews(NORP) condemned mr galloway(PERSON) ’s win as a “ dark day ” for the uk(GPE) ’s jewish(NORP) community , while labour apologised for not campaigning against him in rochdale(ORG) . 

mr sunak announced ministers would redouble support for the anti - terrorism prevent programme , demand universities stop extremist activity on campus and prevent people entering the uk(GPE) whose “ aim is to undermine its values ” . 

in remarks likely to be seen as more controversial , mr sunk also urged the public to reject when extremists ” claim that britain(GPE) is and has been on the wrong side of history ” . 

he said : “ no country is perfect , but i am enormously proud of the good that our country has done . 

“ and when these groups … tell children that the system is rigged against them or that britain(GPE) is a racist country … this is not only a lie , but a cynical attempt to crush young dreams , and turn impressionistic minds against their own society . ” 

home secretary james(PERSON) cleverly(PERSON) has also been instructed that those in the uk(GPE) on visas who choose to “ spew hate ” will have their right to be in the country removed . 

the labour leader backed mr sunak(PERSON) ’s intervention , saying : “ the prime minister is right to advocate unity and to condemn the unacceptable and intimidatory behaviour that we have seen recently . ” 

but conservative peer lord(PERSON) vaizey(PERSON) said “ many in the tory party should look to themselves ” when it comes to the toxification of public life after accusations it has stoked division on issues from brexit to asylum seekers . 

labour also lashed out at the new mp as someone who is “ only interested in stoking fear and division ” . 

the party had dropped its own candidate for making antisemitic remarks , leaving the door open for mr galloway(PERSON) , an alleged antisemite notorious for stoking division and courting controversy . 

sir keir(PERSON) starmer(PERSON) said following the result : “ galloway only won because labour did n’t stand a candidate . i regret that we had to withdraw a candidate and apologise to voters in rochdale(ORG) . but i took that decision . it was the right decision . 

“ and when i say i changed the(ORG) labour(ORG) party(ORG) , i mean it . obviously we will put a first(ORDINAL) - class candidate , a unifier , before the voters in rochdale(ORG) at the general election . ” 

a labour spokesperson added : “ rochdale deserved the chance to vote for an mp that would bring communities together and deliver for working people . 

“ george(PERSON) galloway(PERSON) is only interested in stoking fear and division . as an mp he will be a damaging force in our communities and public life . ” 

as the implications of mr galloway(PERSON) ’s return to parliament became clear : 

- the board of deputies of british(NORP) jews said it was a “ dark day ” for the uk(GPE) ’s jewish(NORP) community 

- mr sunak said the campaign for the rochdale by - election was “ one(CARDINAL) of the most divisive in recent times ” 

- senior tory mps(PERSON) called for politicians from all sides of the spectrum to stop inflaming public tensions 

- greater manchester(GPE) mayor andy(PERSON) burnham(PERSON) said labour had “ let the people of rochdale down ” 

- mr galloway(PERSON) said the “ zionist apartheid state of israel(GPE) ” has no right to exist 

- his deputy , former labour mp chris(PERSON) williamson(PERSON) , refused to condemn the hamas(ORG) 7(CARDINAL) october terror attacks 

mr galloway(PERSON) ’s workers party of great britain(GPE) won with just(CARDINAL) under(CARDINAL) 40 per cent of the vote , a majority of 5,697(CARDINAL) over second(ORDINAL) - placed david(PERSON) tully(PERSON) , a local businessman and independent candidate . 

in his victory speech , mr galloway(PERSON) said : “ keir(PERSON) starmer(PERSON) , this is for gaza(GPE) . ” it echoed the message mr galloway(PERSON) sent upon his 2005(DATE) win in the bethnal green and bow constituency , when he said : “ mr(PERSON) blair(PERSON) , this is for iraq(GPE) . ” 

he added : “ you have paid , and you will pay , a high price for the role that you have played in enabling , encouraging and covering for the catastrophe presently going on in occupied palestine(GPE) in the(GPE) gaza(GPE) strip(GPE) . ” 

a spokesperson for the board of deputies of british(NORP) jews said : “ george(PERSON) galloway(PERSON) is a demagogue and conspiracy theorist who has brought the politics of division and hate to every place he has ever stood for parliament . 

“ his election is a dark day for the jewish(NORP) community in this country and for british(NORP) politics in general . ” 

meanwhile , a spokesperson for the campaign against antisemitism said : “ george(PERSON) galloway(PERSON) is an inflammatory firebrand with an atrocious record of baiting the jewish(NORP) community . 

“ his endurance in our public life serves to exploit extremist sentiment and divide communities . ” 

asked if mr galloway(PERSON) ’s election win would inflame tensions , the prime minister said : “ it was very concerning to see the reports of intimidation through the by - election , and by all accounts one(CARDINAL) of the most divisive campaigns that we ’ve seen in recent times . " 

and in a sign of the controversy to come after mr galloway(PERSON) ’s return , his deputy yesterday(DATE) morning(TIME) refused to condemn the 7(DATE) october(DATE) hamas terror attacks on israel(GPE) . 

former labour mp chris(PERSON) williamson(PERSON) , who was suspended from the party for claiming it had “ given too much ground ” and been “ too apologetic ” in tackling antisemitism , is now the deputy leader of mr galloway(PERSON) ’s workers party of britain(GPE) . 

the jeremy(PERSON) corbyn(PERSON) ally told bbc(ORG) radio 4(CARDINAL) ’s today(DATE) programme : “ you ca n’t expect to live in a situation where people have been oppressed for 75(DATE) years(DATE) and not expect a reaction . ” 

he added : “ in international law , oppressed peoples have an absolute right to armed resistance , ” before going on to claim that the majority of those innocent people killed on 7(DATE) october(DATE) were killed by israeli(NORP) forces . 

labour(ORG) ’s deputy national campaign coordinator ellie(PERSON) reeves(PERSON) said she was “ utterly appalled by mr williamson(PERSON) ’s failure to condemn hamas(ORG) attacks on the(DATE) seventh(DATE) of(DATE) october(DATE) , and likewise his failure to distance his party from the endorsement of [ former president of the far - right british(NORP) national party ] nick(PERSON) griffin(PERSON) ”(PERSON) . 

and , in comments likely to further inflame tensions amid israel(GPE) ’s war on gaza(GPE) , mr galloway(PERSON) went on to tell sky news that the “ zionist apartheid state of israel(GPE) ” has no right to exist . 

top tories came together to warn tensions are already running high and stress the importance of taking the heat out of political debate . 

senior conservative mp(PERSON) david(PERSON) davis(PERSON) , who will introduce mr galloway(PERSON) alongside jeremy(PERSON) corbyn(PERSON) in the(ORG) house(ORG) of(ORG) commons(ORG) on monday(DATE) , said “ the temperature of politics has got very high ” . 

and mr davis(PERSON) said mr galloway(PERSON) serves as “ a sharp reminder ” that “ if we want to make progress as a democracy you have to be able to debate in civilised terms and accept that other people have real differences from you ” . 

the former cabinet minister told the independent : “ the general temperature of politics has got very high … even intra - party as well as between parties . 

“ for democracy to operate properly we have to be able to reach a decision and ideally build a consensus or very solid majority around that , and that has not been happening for years(DATE) . ” 

and former justice secretary sir robert(PERSON) buckland(PERSON) said mr galloway(PERSON) ’s election should was “ all about divisiveness ” , adding that it should serve as “ a general call to arms ” to take the heat out of political debate . 

speaking after visiting a sixth(ORDINAL) form college , sir robert(PERSON) told the independent that “ we owe an example to the next generation to do our politics better ” . 

“ that does not mean no disagreement or argument , of course it means lively debate , but disagreeing agreeably as we have done in britain(GPE) for generations . ” 

he added : “ the more we spread the language of divisiveness and otherness and hate , the more you ’ll see politicians like jo(PERSON) cox(PERSON) losing their lives or david(PERSON) amess(PERSON) losing their lives , and the darker and sadder a place our political life will be … 

“ and that ’s why last(TIME) night(TIME) was a profoundly depressing result , frankly . ” 

and sir robert(PERSON) described mr galloway(PERSON) as a “ demagogue ” who “ comes and goes and leaves damage in his wake ” . 

and he said all sides of the political spectrum have been guilty of furthering public division and that politics should be about “ solutions ” , not trying to “ inflame ” debate . 

and greater manchester(GPE) mayor andy(PERSON) burnham(PERSON) said labour had “ let the people of rochdale down because it did n’t give them a good enough choice ” . 

and , in a warning to mr galloway(PERSON) , mr burnham(PERSON) warned that he will “ stand up to anybody who seeks to bring division or hate to our city region ” . 

left - wing pressure group momentum described labour ’s rochdale by - election results as “ self - inflicted ” . a spokesperson for the group said : “ this was a needless and self - inflicted loss for labour . 

“ first(ORDINAL) , ( labour leader sir keir(PERSON) )(PERSON) starmer(PERSON) ’s utterly factional selection processes resulted in a candidate who was clearly unfit for office . then the labour leadership tried to defend him as one of their own . 

“ finally , keir(PERSON) starmer(PERSON) ’s failure to stand with gaza(GPE) in its hour of need left the door open for george(PERSON) galloway(PERSON) . 

“ to avoid any more damaging repeats , starmer(PERSON) should end the factional abuse of labour ’s selection processes and stand up for an immediate , permanent ceasefire in gaza(GPE) . ” 

the rochdale(ORG) campaign has been mired in controversy and claims of intimidation and divisive tactics . 

labour withdrew support for its candidate , azhar(PERSON) ali(PERSON) , after a recording emerged in which he claimed israel(GPE) was complicit in the terrorist attacks of 7(DATE) october(DATE) , seeing mr galloway(PERSON) become the firm favourite for the seat . 

mr ali(PERSON) remained listed as the labour candidate as the party ’s decision came too late for ballot papers to be changed . 

labour said it “ will quickly begin the process to select a new labour candidate for the general election ” . 

nigel(PERSON) farage(PERSON) ’s(PERSON) reform uk also suffered a poor result in the seat , gaining just 6 per cent of the vote , much lower than its national poll rating of around(MONEY) 10(MONEY) per(MONEY) cent(MONEY) . leader richard(PERSON) tice(PERSON) claimed his candidate , former rochdale(ORG) mp simon(PERSON) danczuk(PERSON) , had received a death threat during the campaign and said his party ’s campaign team had been subject to “ daily(DATE) intimidation and slurs ” . 

pollster luke(PERSON) tryl(PERSON) , of more in common , said the results were “ terrible ” for all the main parties . he pointed to the performance of second(ORDINAL) - placed mr tully(PERSON) as almost more significant than mr galloway(PERSON) ’s win . 

“ but the circumstances mean it is far more likely the lesson here is one(CARDINAL) about candidate selection and due diligence than about public opinion more broadly , ” he added . 

labour(ORG) ’s ellie(PERSON) reeves(PERSON) said the party will not change its position on gaza(GPE) despite mr galloway(PERSON) warning after the by - election result it will pay “ a high price ” nationally . 

she told sky news : “ we ’ve set out our position on gaza(GPE) and that was adopted by the commons just the(DATE) other(DATE) week(DATE) . 

“ we ’ve said there should be an immediate humanitarian ceasefire , that the loss of life has been intolerable , there must be no ground offensive in rafah , aid has to be ramped up into the region , and , importantly , that we need to find a two(CARDINAL) - state solution . ”

UK(GPE) - gas - grid - network - underground - tunnel : 

incredible 177,000(QUANTITY) -(QUANTITY) mile(QUANTITY) secret network of underground tunnels could save uk £ 28billion(MONEY) 

exclusive : the uk(GPE) should repurpose a huge system of subterranean pipes and tunnels to aid its transition to a cleaner , greener future , an expert has said . 

ena(ORG) shares a hydrogen vision for the uk(GPE) 

a hidden network of pipes beneath britain(GPE) has been described as a rare “ national treasure ” with exciting possibilities . 

the national net zero(CARDINAL) drive can be helped by repurposing this already - existing infrastructure into a cleaner energy distribution system , a leading industry expert has argued . 

sarah(PERSON) williams(PERSON) , director of regulation , asset strategy & hs&e at gas transportation firm wales(ORG) &(ORG) west(ORG) utilities , says britain(GPE) ’s gas grid , which she described as “ the equivalent of the uk(GPE) ’s motorways ” , should be remodelled so it can be used to transport hydrogen . 

and she is urging the uk(GPE) government to rapidly invest in homegrown hydrogen production to speed up the decarbonisation process . 

read more : the new £(MONEY) 100(MONEY) m(MONEY) junction that will end chaos on one(CARDINAL) of britain(GPE) ’s busiest motorways 

shedding light on the little - known distribution network of pipes underneath the uk(GPE) , she told express.co.uk : “ across the uk(GPE) , we 've got 285,000(QUANTITY) kilometres(QUANTITY) ( 177,000(QUANTITY) miles(QUANTITY) ) of pipes under the ground . we need to be able to reuse that . ” 

she added : “ there 's obviously a school of thought that says we should go to electrification and we should decommission the gas network . 

“ but there is a cost to decommission the gas network . the(ORG) national(ORG) infrastructure(ORG) commission(ORG) recently published a report into the future of great britain(GPE) 's gas grid , and they suggested that it would be £ 28billion(MONEY) cheaper to repurpose the network and use it for hydrogen than to decommission it . 

“ our vision is we have these pipes today(DATE) so we should use them . this network is like a national treasure that nobody really even thinks about . 

“ last(DATE) year(DATE) 30(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) of our electricity was generated from gas , but the interlinkage between that and our power system is poorly understood . ” 

ms williams(PERSON) said her company was responsible for serving 2.5(CARDINAL) million(CARDINAL) customers across an area containing a population of roughly(CARDINAL) 7.5(CARDINAL) million(CARDINAL) people in wales(GPE) and the(LOC) south(LOC) west(LOC) of(LOC) england(LOC) . 

she said : “ we cover big cities like bristol(ORG) , cardiff , exeter(PERSON) and taunton(PERSON) . and then we go right through into dartmoor(ORG) , exmoor(GPE) , the(ORG) brecon(ORG) beacons(ORG) , and everything in between , including cornwall . ” 

ms williams(PERSON) added : “ it 's really important to note that our domestic customers are attached to exactly the same pipes as the businesses and industrial consumers . 

“ people imagine that industry and businesses and have their own gas pipes and then homes are connected to a separate network , but they 're not . they 're interconnected . ” 

the energy expert is now calling on the uk(GPE) to exploit a newfound opportunity to harness its own homegrown hydrogen supply . 

she said : “ the homegrown hydrogen opportunity is really what you want to see in the uk(GPE) . 

“ and you would think that there is a great opportunity for us to do that . 

“ but a bit more speed and pace from the government is going to be required to really give that investment signal that the uk(GPE) is the place to invest in hydrogen for the future . ” 

ms williams(PERSON) cited the resource ’s reliability when asked about the benefits of using gas as an energy source . 

she said : “ one(CARDINAL) of the main benefits is reliability : you typically will experience no(CARDINAL) more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) one(CARDINAL) gas interruption in your whole life , which is very different to an electricity connection where , typically , you may experience an interruption once every year or a(DATE) couple(DATE) of(DATE) years(DATE) . ” 

but she went on to admit there were still some challenges associated with repurposing the uk(GPE) gas grid to be used for hydrogen . 

she said : “ obviously we would absolutely not put anything into a customer 's home that was n't as safe as what we 've got today(DATE) . 

“ and the health and safety executive are working alongside us , but equally looking at the viability so we 're looking at we 've got about(PERCENT) 80(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) of our pipes already plastic , so they are suitable for hydrogen to be put through them . 

“ so it 's about understanding how we get from that production to distribution into the customer 's home . i think technically , it 's relatively simple . 

“ i think it 's more around the making sure that all of the different parts have end to end right from production to the consumer home already , and the sequencing of that would have been tested through to the trial . ”

congress(ORG) working(ORG) committee(ORG) ( cwc(ORG) ) member ramesh(PERSON) chennithala(PERSON) has demanded the formation of a special investigation team ( sit ) , led by an officer in the rank of inspector general , to probe the alleged murder of a student on the kerala(GPE) veterinary and animal(ORG) sciences(ORG) university(ORG) campus(ORG) at pookode in wayanad(GPE) . 

addressing the media here on friday(DATE) , he alleged that an attempt was being made by communist(ORG) party(ORG) of(ORG) india(ORG) ( marxist(NORP) ) [ cpi(m ) ] leaders to wipe out the case . he said the cpi(m(ORG) ) leaders , led by former mla(PERSON) c.k(PERSON) . saseendran(PERSON) , had threatened the dysp(ORG) , who was investigating the case , and attempted to protect the suspects in police custody . 

“ siddharth was pressured to join the(ORG) students(ORG) federation(ORG) of(ORG) india(ORG) ( sfi ) , but he was not interested in joining any political outfit . this was the reason he was murdered , ” mr . chennithala(PERSON) said , adding that his family suspected that his body was hung in the room after strangling him to death . 

mr . chennithala(PERSON) also accused the cpi(m(ORG) ) of training goons to reign campuses across state under the sfi banner.he alleged that the station house officer of pookode police station was trying to sabotage the case by depicting it as a suicide , and the teachers in the university with left allegiance had supported the heinous act . “ it was wrong on the part of minister chinchurani(PERSON) to support the dean of the college who obviously had cpi(ORG) ties , ” mr . chennithala(PERSON) said . he would visit the college on saturday(DATE) at 9(TIME) a.m.(TIME) and would take part in the congress(ORG) march at pookode .

why - ai - will - drive - major - pc - market - growth - next(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) : 

editor ’s note : “ why ai will drive major pc market growth in 2024(DATE) ” was previously published in december(DATE) 2023(DATE) . it has since been updated to include the most relevant information available . 

surprise , surprise ! dell(PERSON) ( dell(ORG) ) stock has enjoyed quite a rally recently . it ’s up almost(PERCENT) 45(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) over the(DATE) past(DATE) month(DATE) alone . 

yes , that dell(ORG) – the old - school pc maker . in the(DATE) 1990s(DATE) , it was the hottest stock on wall street . but after the pc market hit a brick wall in the(DATE) 2010s(DATE) , the stock has gone absolutely nowhere … 

until now . 

that dell(ORG) is now up more(PERCENT) than(PERCENT) 60(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) this(DATE) year(DATE) and nearly(PERCENT) 230(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) over the(DATE) past(DATE) 12(DATE) months(DATE) . 

and it ’s all thanks to artificial intelligence . 

in short , ai is creating a renaissance in the pc market . and stocks like dell(ORG) could party like it ’s the 1990s all over again . 

back in the(DATE) 1990s(DATE) and(DATE) early(DATE) 2000s(DATE) , the pc market grew like wildfire as everyone raced to buy computers and get connected to the internet . but in the(DATE) 2010s(DATE) , the market became saturated . there were no new pc buyers . 

so – the market stopped growing . global pc sales have been flat since about(DATE) 2015(DATE) . as a result , pc stocks have been flat , too . but we could be looking at the start of a massive pc upgrade “ supercycle ” that could make pc stocks the hottest on wall street once again . 

an ai - driven pc boom ? 

both dell(ORG) and hp(PERSON) ( hpq ) plan to launch the first(ORDINAL) generation of what they ’re calling “ ai pcs ” – pcs with artificial intelligence built into them . 

they ’ll come with the standard central processing unit ( cpus ) and graphics processing unit ( gpus(GPE) ) that all advanced computers are outfitted with today(DATE) . but they ’ll also have neural processing units ( npus ) , which allow for ai to be run locally on the computers themselves . 

and we ’re confident that these next - gen pcs will unlock the next wave of ai productivity benefits . 

today(DATE) , the only way to access ai is through the cloud . users go to a website or mobile application , and a third(ORDINAL) - party cloud service provider delivers the ai service . this is called the ai - as - a - service ( aiaas(GPE) ) model . 

typically , in this model , the cloud service provider gains access to users ’ data and charges a fee for them to use that service regularly . not to mention , it also requires the internet to use it . 

but with ai pcs , there wo n’t be any data - sharing or recurring fees . users will have artificial intelligence running locally and privately on their own computer . and they ’ll be able to use it whenever , wherever – even without an internet connection . 

imagine being on your computer , pulling up microsoft office or excel , and boom ; there ’s an ai assistant right there to help you craft whatever document or spreadsheet you ’re working on . 

you do n’t need to open a separate window for chatgpt(ORG) or download and pay for copilot . you just tap into the ai that is already built into your computer . 

that is the widely accessible future that ai pcs will usher in . 

and we think this future has huge economic potential . 

the pc market could turn red - hot in a flash 

obviously , on the consumer side of things , it ’s easy to see how these ai pcs become ubiquitous . one(CARDINAL) person buys one . then everyone around them realizes how cool it is to have artificial intelligence built into your own computer . and suddenly , we see a major snowball effect , where everyone wants and gets their own ai pc . 

but the bigger potential here lies on the enterprise side of things – because that ’s where the benefits of these next - gen pcs will really shine . 

it ’s costly for a company to buy every employee a license to chatgpt(ORG) or copilot . it ’s also scary to openly share all your data with cloud ai platforms . but at the same time , it ’s now absolutely necessary for companies to get the power of artificial intelligence into their employees ’ hands . 

and the only way to deploy artificial intelligence while minimizing cost and protecting data is to use ai pcs . 

therefore , we believe that when dell(ORG) and hp(PRODUCT) launch their ai pcs in 2024(DATE) and ‘ 25(CARDINAL) , companies across america(GPE) will go on an ai pc shopping spree . it ’s very likely that your next company laptop will be an ai pc . 

what does that mean for the sleepy pc market ? 

explosive growth for the first(ORDINAL) time in 20(DATE) years(DATE) . 

the final word 

according to research firm canalys(ORG) , the global pc market is set to grow by 8(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) in 2024(DATE) after contracting in both(DATE) 2022(DATE) and ‘ 23 . then it ’s expected to rise another(PERCENT) ~20(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) in 2025(DATE) . 

and this coming ai pc supercycle is creating some compelling opportunities in pc stocks . 

just consider ; hpq trades at just 8x next(DATE) year(DATE) ’s(DATE) earnings . 

that ’s a dirt - cheap multiple . and it only make sense if hp(PERSON) is n’t going to grow over the(DATE) next(DATE) few(DATE) years(DATE) . but in fact , it could grow by more(PERCENT) than(PERCENT) 10(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) over the(DATE) next(DATE) two(DATE) years(DATE) . 

therefore , hpq offers an underrated and undervalued way to play the ai boom . 

i would n’t be surprised if ai pc stocks go parabolic next(DATE) year(DATE) and end up being some of the market ’s biggest winners . 

but in fact , these stocks are n’t my favorite way to play the ai trend in 2024(DATE) . 

rather , i ’ve got my sights set on a different corner of the market . and it ’s one that some of the world ’s most powerful people and companies are pouring money into right now . think nvidia ( nvda ) , microsoft(ORG) ( msft ) , tesla ( tsla(PERSON) ) , amazon(ORG) ( amzn ) , elon musk and jeff(PERSON) bezos(PERSON) . 

we believe we ’re seeing the ai boom ’s next evolution unfold . and that means it ’s time to grab your slice of the pie . 

find out how to do just that right now with a few of our favorite stock picks .

01(DATE) -(DATE) 03(DATE) -(DATE) 2024(DATE) | by robin(PERSON) mitchell(PERSON) 

key things to know : 

- uk schools are installing sensors in student toilets to combat bullying and vaping , sparking a debate on privacy and safety . 

- critics , including big brother watch , argue that such surveillance measures infringe on students ' privacy rights and could foster a mistrustful environment . 

- the sensors are designed to detect specific keywords and air quality indicators , aiming to alert staff in real - time to incidents within these private spaces . 

- the effectiveness and ethical implications of these sensors are under scrutiny , with concerns about potential abuse and the need for less intrusive solutions . 

in what can only be described as beyond creepy , some schools in the uk(GPE) have started to install sensors into student toilets to identify potential bullying and vaping . however , while the use of sensors may originate from good intentions , it opens up a pandora ’s box of potential abuse . what challenges do toilet environments present to educators , what are some schools starting to do , and why is the use of sensors in such environments a recipe for disaster ? 

students and bathrooms – a dangerous mix 

anyone who is reading this article will likely have been a student in a typical school , making friends of all age groups , learning about the wonders of the world , and , from time to time , getting up to no good . but while passing notes in class and making fun of the odd teacher for doing something embarrassing is perfectly normal behaviour , there are other behaviours and traits that are somewhat more concerning . 

one(CARDINAL) such behaviour is bullying , which itself can be traumatising for those who fall victim to it . in fact , there are countless cases of student suicides and acts of gross violence which directly arise from bullying , hence the importance of stopping bullying in all its forms . 

sadly , trying to catch bullying in the act is often extremely difficult , as those who bully will do so when not under supervision ( arising from cowardice ) . furthermore , bullying is n’t just a physical phenomenon , as verbal bullying can be just as devastating if not more than physical bullying . in many ways , it is far easier to prevent a bully from physically assaulting students than it is to prevent an(DATE) entire(DATE) year(DATE) group from ostracising a single student . 

to make matters worse , bullies will often look for areas that are secluded and/or private so that they can reduce the chance of getting caught , which makes bathrooms prime locations . due to the private nature of such areas , installing cameras is out of the question , and having staff situated on - site introduces all kinds of privacy issues and impacts the safety of students . 

of course , bullying is n’t the only issue that can occur in such spaces ; the rise of vaping has seen large amounts of uptake amongst under-18s due to their easy access , reduced toxicity compared to regular tobacco , and ability to be extremely discrete . while vaping itself is significantly less dangerous compared to regular tobacco , there is concern that it could still be introducing toxins into the body as well as encouraging other behaviours , including potential drug use . 

schools in the uk(GPE) introducing sensors into toilets 

in response to the challenges faced by staff with regard to vaping and bullying , some schools across the uk(GPE) have begun to introduce smart sensors into bathrooms that actively listen to students and detect air quality . 

the initiative , as detailed by schools(DATE) week(DATE) , has been met with mixed reactions . on one(CARDINAL) hand , it represents a proactive step towards mitigating issues like vaping and bullying within school premises . these sensors , equipped with the capability to recognise specific keywords and monitor for signs of vaping , aim to alert staff in real - time , thereby enabling swift intervention . however , this technological solution has also raised significant privacy concerns , with critics arguing that it encroaches on students ' rights to privacy and could foster an environment of surveillance rather than trust . 

in the case of vaping , specialised vape sensors that can detect the by - products of vaping ( such as glycerol ) are required , as regular smoke alarms can not detect vaping . but in the case of bullying , such devices are turning to keyword detection via on - device ai . 

by looking for key phrases , such as “ help me ” and “ stop it ” , it becomes possible for such devices to identify potential cases of bullying and sexual assault as it happens and then inform staff members to enable real - time responses . furthermore , as such devices can be networked , it also becomes possible for messages to be sent to remote devices regardless of where they are , thus allowing staff off - site to be notified . 

the debate around these sensors is not just about their effectiveness but also their impact on students ' perception of privacy . big brother watch has voiced strong opposition to this approach , labeling it a " gross violation of children 's privacy " ( big brother watch ) . the organisation stresses the importance of safeguarding children 's rights in educational settings , urging schools to seek less intrusive methods for addressing disciplinary issues . this highlights the complex balance schools must navigate between leveraging technology for safety and maintaining a respectful and trusting educational environment . 

while numerous device managers exist , two(CARDINAL) that have received special attention are halo devices , which can be preprogrammed with keywords , and 3d sense pro sensor ( from triton ) , which comes with ten(CARDINAL) preprogrammed phrases and space for ten(CARDINAL) additional phrases . such sensors have already been deployed in around 1,500(CARDINAL) schools across the us(GPE) , and it is believed that around(CARDINAL) 30(CARDINAL) to(CARDINAL) 40(CARDINAL) devices have been used in the uk(GPE) , with device manufacturers anticipating greater adoption throughout the(DATE) next(DATE) few(DATE) years(DATE) . 

why are such sensors a recipe for disasters ? 

no one can deny that bullying is a disgusting practice and that students , parents , and teachers should do everything they can to identify and stop it . however , there are some lines that should n’t be crossed , and the installation of sensors into private spaces where students are exceptionally vulnerable clearly crosses this line . 

while the technology itself may be benign to some degree , the use of such technology in bathrooms is ripe for abuse . for example , it would n’t be difficult for anyone , student or staff , to partially dismantle such hardware and integrate other equipment , such as cameras and/or microphones . 

for those with more technical capabilities , such sensors could potentially be hacked and adjusted to stream conversations in real time . if such sensors are connected to a network with internet access , then it also becomes possible for hackers anywhere in the world to gain entry and upload firmware that allows for remote control . 

to make matters worse , it would n’t be entirely difficult for an engineer to fake such a device , adding all kinds of surveillance hardware while providing similar features to other mainstream alternatives . this would leave students extremely vulnerable to predation , which itself could last for years(DATE) . 

overall , the idea of installing sensors in a student bathroom to monitor for bullying is a complete invasion of privacy and something that must be discouraged , if not outlawed .

india(GPE) - protests - thai - envoys - remarks - at - wto - in - abu - dhabi-695790 : 

india(GPE) strongly objects to thai(NORP) envoy 's remarks at wto(ORG) meet in abu(GPE) dhabi(GPE) : reports 

story highlights 

despite the ongoing discussions , the 13th(ORDINAL) ministerial conference of the wto concluded on march(DATE) 1(DATE) without significant decisions on crucial issues such as finding a permanent solution to public food stockpiling and curbing fisheries subsidies . 

india(GPE) has taken a firm stance against the remarks made by thailand(GPE) 's ambassador pimchanok(PERSON) vonkorpon(PERSON) pitfield(PERSON) to the(ORG) world(ORG) trade(ORG) organization(ORG) ( wto(ORG) ) in abu(GPE) dhabi(GPE) . 

the remarks reportedly targeted india(GPE) 's public stockholding program , a critical component of its agricultural policy , aiming to support farmers by ensuring stable prices for essential crops and maintaining food security for its population . 

notably , this program has been a subject of discussion and negotiation at the(ORG) world(ORG) trade(ORG) organization(ORG) ( wto(ORG) ) due to concerns about its potential impact on global trade dynamics . 

reports citing sources said that pitfield(PERSON) 's comments were ' offensive ' in nature and criticised india(GPE) 's rice procurement program . pitfield(PERSON) blamed the program and said that the country is exporting 40(PERCENT) percent(PERCENT) of procured rice for its public distribution systems ( pds ) to boost its export market . 

the comment sparked tensions following which india(GPE) lodged a strong protest and the thai(NORP) ambassador was replaced .

catholic(NORP) - bishops - object - to - senate - ivf - bill - warn - against - deaths - of - preborn - children : 

washington(GPE) , d.c(GPE) .(GPE) newsroom , mar(DATE) 1(DATE) ,(DATE) 2024(DATE) /(DATE) 19:00(DATE) pm(DATE) ( cna ) . 

catholic(NORP) bishops are urging lawmakers to oppose a bill that would create a federally sanctioned right to access in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) — a fertility treatment that has resulted in the deaths of millions(CARDINAL) of human embryos in the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) . 

the bill , called the access to family building act , was introduced by sen . tammy(PERSON) duckworth(PERSON) , d(GPE) -(GPE) illinois(GPE) . this legislation would establish a federally protected right to ivf access , preempting state - imposed restrictions . 

“ we can understand the profound desire that motivates some of these couples to go to great lengths to have children , and we support morally licit means of doing so , ” the heads of four(CARDINAL) united states conference of catholic(NORP) bishops ’ committees wrote in a letter to lawmakers . 

“ the solution , however , can never be a medical process that involves the creation of countless preborn children and results in most of them being frozen or discarded and destroyed , ” the bishops emphasized . 

the four(CARDINAL) signatories were bishop michael(PERSON) burbidge(PERSON) , who chairs the usccb ’s committee on pro - life activities ; bishop robert(PERSON) barron(PERSON) , who chairs the committee on laity , marriage , family life , and youth ; archbishop borys(PERSON) gudziak(PERSON) , who chairs the committee on domestic justice and human development ; and bishop kevin(PERSON) rhoades(PERSON) , the chairman of the committee for religious liberty . 

ivf(ORG) , the bishops warned , is “ a threat to the most vulnerable of human beings . ” they further rebuked the ivf industry as one that is “ built on millions(CARDINAL) of children who are created to be destroyed or abandoned . ” 

“ contrary to what some have claimed , a position that supports legal enshrinement of ivf(ORG) , however well - intended , is neither pro - life nor pro - child , ” the bishops added . “ approaches such as investing in life - affirming research on infertility , or strengthening support for couples who desire to adopt , would be better to explore . ” 

ivf(ORG) is a fertility treatment in which doctors fuse sperm and eggs to create human embryos and implant them in the mother ’s womb without a sexual act . embryos that are intended to be implanted at a(DATE) later(DATE) date(DATE) are frozen . undesired embryos are routinely destroyed or used for scientific research , which kills those preborn children . 

duckworth(ORG) ’s(ORG) ivf(ORG) bill(ORG) was introduced in response to an alabama(ORG) supreme(ORG) court(ORG) decision , which ruled that human embryos are legal persons under the state ’s wrongful death of a minor act . with significant republican(NORP) support , both chambers of the alabama(GPE) legislature passed a bill that would shield ivf(ORG) clinics(ORG) from criminal and civil liability in cases of embryo deaths . 

because of an objection on the senate(ORG) floor from sen . cindy(PERSON) hyde(PERSON) -(PERSON) smith(PERSON) , r - mississippi , the bill was blocked from advancing via unanimous consent and must go through the committee process before it can receive a vote . 

hyde(PERSON) -(PERSON) smith(PERSON) claimed that the bill , dubbed the access to family building act , would go “ far beyond providing legal access to ivf(ORG) . ” she suggested that it would force religious groups to facilitate ivf(ORG) procedures and cover such procedures in their insurance plans . she also said it would legalize human cloning , three(CARDINAL) - parent embryos , and gene - edited designer babies . 

duckworth rejected that characterization , claiming the legislation would simply prevent states from restricting access to ivf(ORG) procedures . she said it would not force anyone to provide them or cover them . 

“ this bill does three(CARDINAL) things and three(CARDINAL) things only , ” duckworth said in response to hyde(PERSON) -(PERSON) smith(PERSON) . 

“ it protects the right of individuals to seek assisted reproductive technology without fear of being prosecuted , ” duckworth continued . “ … it preserves the right of physicians to provide that assisted reproductive technology without fear of being prosecuted . and it also allows insurance companies to cover assisted reproductive technology . ” 

hyde(PERSON) -(PERSON) smith(PERSON) and dozens(CARDINAL) of other republicans(NORP) continued to emphasize that they support access to ivf(ORG) despite the destruction to human life that is integral to the process . several lawmakers have even suggested that supporting ivf(ORG) is pro - life . 

“ i support the ability for mothers and fathers to have total access to ivf(ORG) and [ to bring ] new life into the world , ” hyde(ORG) -(ORG) smith(ORG) said when objecting to the proposal . “ i also believe human life should be protected . ” 

rep . nancy(PERSON) mace(PERSON) , r(LOC) -(LOC) south(LOC) carolina(LOC) , has already introduced a resolution that would affirm the(ORG) house(ORG) of(ORG) representatives(ORG) ’ support for ivf(ORG) . supporters of ivf(ORG) include former president donald(PERSON) trump(PERSON) , the(ORG) national(ORG) republican(ORG) senatorial(ORG) committee(ORG) , and the congressional leadership fund , which is the main house republican(NORP) political action committee .

what - is - oxybenzone-48485300 : 

what is oxybenzone ? the controversial sunscreen ingredient , explained 

sunscreen is arguably the most important step in any skin - care routine , and if you use one regularly , then you should know that its purpose is to protect your skin from the sun 's harmful uv rays that ( without the proper precautions ) can have a citadel of consequences , from skin cancer , dark spots , and premature aging , among other things . you may have also heard conflicting arguments about controversial ingredients commonly found in some spf products , like oxybenzone . 

if you 're unfamiliar , oxybenzone is present in many chemical sunscreens , though it 's been flagged by many organizations — particularly the environmental working group ( ewg(ORG) ) — for being potentially harmful to our bodies and coral reefs . to get a better understanding of the sunscreen ingredient , read ahead as a dermatologist explains everything you need to know about oxybenzone . 

what is oxybenzone ? 

oxybenzone is a derivative of benzophenone and a common sunscreen ingredient used in sunscreens . but unlike mineral formulas that physically block your skin from the sun , oxybenzone is an active ingredient found in chemical sunscreens . 

" [ it 's ] not physical , therefore instead of sitting on top of the skin , it 's actually absorbed to filter out uv rays via a chemical reaction , " multi - specialist physician azza(PERSON) halim(PERSON) , md(GPE) ,(GPE) tells popsugar . 

why is oxybenzone so controversial ? 

while oxybenzone is an fda(ORG) - approved chemical , and the(ORG) american(ORG) academy(ORG) of(ORG) dermatology(ORG) ( aad(ORG) ) considers the ingredient safe to use when it comes to human health , it 's also one(CARDINAL) of several common chemical sunscreen ingredients like avobenzone , octisalate , homosalate , and octinoxate that the ewg has flagged . why ? according to dr . halim(PERSON) , some research indicates that ( like in the peer - reviewed journal of the(ORG) american(ORG) medical(ORG) association(ORG) ) , because it can be absorbed by the skin , oxybenzone can potentially affect hormone levels in animals . 

" chemicals are chemicals with different safety profiles , and we do know that oxybenzone has been attributed to hormone / endocrine disruption , and it 's been found in breast - milk samples of lactating mothers , " she says . " research has shown a potential link between oxybenzone and lower testosterone levels in adolescent boys , hormone changes in men , and shorter pregnancies and disrupted birth weights in babies . " 

more recent research suggests that oxybenzone is damaging to coral reefs . according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa(ORG) ) , oxybenzone can cause defects and reproduction issues in fish , damage the immune systems of sea urchins , and impair the growth of green algae . as a result , in 2021(DATE) , hawaii(GPE) became the first(ORDINAL) state to ban the sale of sunscreen products containing the ingredient . 

should i stop using sunscreen with oxybenzone ? 

while the data on how oxybenzone impacts human health is limited , and oversimplifying the science or calling an ingredient " good " or " bad " without a full understanding of the research can lead to misinformation among consumers , whether you choose to use the ingredient depends on your personal preference . sunscreen is a key skin - care product to have in your routine if you want to protect your skin 's health , and the above research has n't been substantial enough for the fda(ORG) to rule oxybenzone sunscreens unsafe to use . 

that said , if you are using a sunscreen with the ingredient in it and want to swap it out for something more environmentally friendly , you can opt for a mineral sunscreen . " the fewer ingredients in a product , the better , which is why when looking for an effective sunscreen , one can find plenty of physical sunblocks that contain only(CARDINAL) two(CARDINAL) ingredients : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide with an spf of 50(CARDINAL) to ward off both uva(FAC) and uvb(ORG) , " dr . halim(PERSON) says .

pennsylvania(GPE) - partners - with - dhs - cisa - censors - to - target - election - speech - it - deems - a - threat : 

democratic(NORP) pennsylvania(GPE) gov . josh(PERSON) shapiro(PERSON) announced thursday(DATE) the state would partner with state and federal agencies , including the(ORG) u.s(ORG) .(ORG) department(ORG) of(ORG) homeland(ORG) security(ORG) , to “ mitigate threats ” to elections , such as speech it deems “ misinformation . ” the(ORG) pennsylvania(ORG) state(ORG) department(ORG) separately revealed to the federalist that the task force ’s cooperation with dhs(ORG) would include “ continu[ing ] to work closely ” with the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency ( cisa ) . 

shapiro(PERSON) created the “ pennsylvania(GPE) election threats task force ” that will “ coordinate plans to mitigate threats to the election process , protect voters from intimidation , and provide voters with accurate , trusted election information . ” 

“ the election threats task force will ensure all levels of government are working together to combat misinformation , ” the press release continued . secretary of the commonwealth al(PERSON) schmidt(PERSON) said the force would target those who spread “ lies and baseless conspiracy theories ” or attempt “ to delegitimize our safe , secure , and accurate elections . ” 

the state provided no public information about what the task force ’s collaboration with dhs(ORG) would look like , but after multiple inquiries , the(ORG) department(ORG) of(ORG) state(ORG) revealed the partnership would include collaboration with cisa , which falls under dhs(ORG) . 

“ the(ORG) department(ORG) of(ORG) state(ORG) will continue to work closely with the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) department(GPE) of homeland security and its cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency ( cisa ) , ” said press matt(PERSON) heckel(PERSON) of the(ORG) state(ORG) department(ORG) ’s(ORG) communications office . “ the formation of the election threats task force will allow us to open lines of communication and share intelligence among the included government agencies . ” 

it is unclear what “ intelligence ” is being referred to or what will be done with said information . 

cisa has a history of censoring election - related speech 

in working with cisa , pennsylvania(GPE) is partnering with the “ nerve center ” of the censorship efforts the federal government has weaponized against americans(NORP) and their free speech , including speech about election integrity . shapiro(PERSON) said part of the task force ’s mission is to “ combat misinformation , ” but cisa has used the “ misinformation ” smear to wrongfully censor online speech before . 

[ read : government censorship op targeted the federalist ’s mollie(PERSON) hemingway(PERSON) , sean(PERSON) davis(PERSON) during 2020(DATE) election ] 

cisa , which has facilitated collusion between big tech companies and federal agencies to flag speech the government disapproves of , does n’t just target free speech it claims is false , but also punishes americans(NORP) for “ malformation , ” which the agency defines as anything “ based on fact , but used out of context to mislead , harm , or manipulate . ” 

cisa(ORG) director jen(ORG) easterly(ORG) put it in more dystopian terms , explaining the agency wants to secure the public ’s “ cognitive infrastructure . ” 

documents obtained by america(GPE) first(ORDINAL) legal show that cisa was aware of risks associated with unsupervised mail - in voting ahead of the 2020(DATE) election but still chose to classify social media posts pointing out similar concerns as “ disinformation ” before flagging them to be censored . 

internally , cisa went so far as to create a six(CARDINAL) - point list in october(DATE) 2020(DATE) warning of the risks to the mail - in voting process , weeks(DATE) after communications revealed cisa knew that evidence did not support the claim that in - person voting “ increased the spread of covid . ” internal communications also revealed cisa was aware of “ challenges with absentee voting ” including “ high numbers of improperly completed ballots . ” 

but cisa then partnered with consulting firm deloitte and asked them to notify cisa of social media trends about “ narratives relating to ‘ vote - by - mail ’ — and to flag specific social media posts for cisa ’s awareness and attention . ” 

tweets deloitte flagged to cisa included an october(DATE) 2020(DATE) tweet from former president donald(PERSON) trump(PERSON) in which he claimed there were “ big problems and discrepancies with mail in ballots all over the usa ” as well as a tweet from a conservative pundit who , as deloitte described , “ accused twitter of ‘ suppressing ’ a story about the democratic(NORP) presidential nominee ’s son to help the nominee win the election . ”

curiously , shapiro(PERSON) ’s press release did n’t explicitly mention cisa ’s involvement . the omission comes at the same time that some state election officials , such as west(GPE) virginia(GPE) ’s(GPE) secretary of state(ORG) mac(PERSON) warner(PERSON) , have “ pulled away ” from cisa because “ when we have our own federal agencies lying to the american(NORP) people , that ’s the most insidious thing that we can do in elections . ” 

but cisa is no stranger to working in the shadows . the agency has tried to cover up its tracks in recent(DATE) years(DATE) , according to a report from the(ORG) house(ORG) select(ORG) subcommittee(ORG) on the weaponization of the federal government detailing cisa ’s “ disinformation ” and surveillance programs . the report claims cisa tried to “ disguise the true nature ” of its work by scrubbing “ references to surveillance and censorship ” from the agency ’s website . 

in an email exchange with the federalist , the(ORG) pennsylvania(ORG) state(ORG) department(ORG) was not immediately forthcoming about the extent of the keystone state ’s partnership with cisa — but the agency ’s license to censor americans(NORP) in the future hangs on a case that ’s currently at the(ORG) supreme(ORG) court(ORG) . 

in missouri(GPE) v. biden(ORG) , now murthy v. missouri(GPE) , the 5th(ORDINAL) circuit court of appeals issued a preliminary injunction in october(DATE) barring the agency from taking any “ actions , formal or informal , directly or indirectly , to coerce or significantly encourage social - media companies to remove , delete , suppress , or reduce , including through altering their algorithms , posted social - media content containing protected free speech . ” the(ORG) supreme(ORG) court(ORG) lifted the injunction while it considers the case , but has yet to rule on the censorship activities of cisa and other biden administration agencies . 

dhs(ORG) says ‘ misinformation ’ is a ‘ terrorism threat ’ 

another partner in pennsylvania(GPE) ’s new “ task force ” is cisa ’s parent agency dhs(ORG) , which has its own history of targeting americans(NORP) ’ free speech under the guise of preventing “ threats . ” 

dhs(ORG) has described an “ online environment ” of “ misinformation ” about covid-19(PERSON) and election integrity as a “ terrorism threat . ” the agency warned the nation remained in a “ heightened threat environment fueled by several factors , including an online environment filled with false or misleading narratives and conspiracy theories , and other forms of mis- dis- and mal - information ( mdm(ORG) ) introduced and/or amplified by foreign and domestic threat actors . ” 

“ these threat actors seek to exacerbate societal friction to sow discord and undermine public trust in government institutions to encourage unrest , which could potentially inspire acts of violence , ” the agency claimed in a february(DATE) 2022(DATE) bulletin . “ for example , there is widespread online proliferation of false or misleading narratives regarding unsubstantiated widespread election fraud and covid-19(DATE) . grievances associated with these themes inspired violent extremist attacks during 2021(DATE) . ” 

the dhs(ORG) , however , failed to provide any evidence of their claims when repeatedly pressed by the daily(DATE) caller news foundation . the agency also targeted americans(NORP) who rejected their governments ’ heavy - handed approach to covid-19(GPE) and questioned lockdown policies . 

the national terrorism advisory system issued a bulletin warning that grievances over “ perceived government restrictions ” and “ anti - government / anti - authority violent extremists ” could pose a domestic terrorist threat . 

this is the same federal department that will now “ coordinate ” with pennsylvania(GPE) to “ mitigate ” so - called “ threats ” and tackle “ misinformation . ”

what - ancient - athens - teach - modern - america(GPE) - law - democracy : 

in december(DATE) the(ORG) supreme(ORG) court(ORG) in the american(NORP) state of colorado(GPE) held that former president donald(PERSON) trump(PERSON) was constitutionally ineligible to run for election again due to the fourteenth(ORDINAL) amendment ’s prohibition on insurrectionists holding office . michigan(GPE) ’s supreme(ORG) court(ORG) held the exact opposite : trump must be placed on the ballot . 

it is now up to the(ORG) us(ORG) supreme(ORG) court(ORG) to resolve the conflict . but for a growing number of observers , conservatives and liberals alike , the fact that courts are playing such a central role is something to be lamented . in their view , the answer to a threat to democracy is not judicial intervention , but rather more democracy . 

if you want to see trump finally defeated , you have to beat him in a free and fair election . 

despite the claims of donald(PERSON) trump(PERSON) and his supporters , there is nothing undemocratic about courts simply doing their job . but is it really true that law and democracy are so at odds ? must we choose between enforcing our laws and saving our democracy ? i think not . 

if anything , the history of law teaches us the opposite lesson . the surest protection against tyranny is a devotion to the rule of law . and nowhere was this clearer than in ancient athens(GPE) . 

the(ORG) democratic(ORG) constitution(ORG) of(ORG) classical(ORG) athens was laid down by three(CARDINAL) great lawgivers – draco(ORG) , solon(ORG) and cleisthenes – but it began with an insurrection . in 632(CARDINAL) bc , an athenian(NORP) nobleman named cylon attempted to overthrow the city ’s traditional system of aristocratic rule . 

with aid from a foreign adversary , the tyrant of megara(GPE) , cylon(PERSON) seized the citadel of athens(GPE) and sought to install himself as dictator . the athenians(NORP) eventually managed to defeat cylon , but soon after recognised that their city needed firmer foundations . draco(PERSON) drafted his famous written legal code a(DATE) decade(DATE) later(DATE) and thereafter athenian(NORP) law remained centrally concerned with the prevention of tyranny . 

the link between law and democracy was made explicit in a strange and imaginative procedure that athenians(NORP) invented for banishing politicians from the scene . introduced in 508(CARDINAL) bc by cleisthenes(NORP) , known as the “ father of athenian(NORP) democracy ” , the procedure , called ostracism , sought to guard(ORG) athenians(ORG) against the conniving ways of corrupt men . 

each(DATE) year(DATE) , the assembly would take a vote on whether they wished to initiate an ostracism , in effect the banishment of a citizen from the city . but importantly , athenians(NORP) did not know who in advance would be banished — they simply voted on whether to trigger the ostracism process itself . 

if a majority voted in favor of triggering an ostracism , then two(DATE) months(DATE) later(DATE) , the ostracism vote itself would take place . in this later vote , each citizen would scratch the name of the leader he wanted banished on a broken piece of pottery known as a potsherd , or ostraca . if at(CARDINAL) least(CARDINAL) 6,000(CARDINAL) potsherds were cast , then the person whose name appeared most frequently on the potsherds would be “ ostracised ” or banished from the city for a period of 10(DATE) years(DATE) . 

for nearly(DATE) a(DATE) century(DATE) , ostracism served as a powerful check on the ambitions of would - be tyrants . athenians came to view their democratic laws with nearly religious reverence . indeed , greek(NORP) mythology held that it was zeus(PERSON) , the king of the gods , who had first(ORDINAL) given law to man . the philosopher aristotle wrote that law made human society possible . “ for as man is the best of animals when perfected , ” aristotle(PERSON) wrote , “ so he is the worst of all when sundered from law and justice . ” 

law , of course , was responsible for its fair share of mischief , too . athenians were famously litigious — aristophanes joked in his play the clouds that “ this ca n’t be athens ; i do n’t see any law courts ” . some abused the legal system to harass and harry(PERSON) their enemies , a practice that came to be known as sycophancy . 

click here to read more from the washington(GPE) examiner 

but these flaws notwithstanding , athenians continued to believe deeply in their laws . there was no greater testament to their success than the resilience of athenian(NORP) democracy itself . their constitution introduced a period of political stability that lasted ( with a few brief exceptions ) for more(DATE) than(DATE) a(DATE) century(DATE) and(DATE) a(DATE) half(DATE) , from 508(CARDINAL) to 322bc(PERSON) . 

this accomplishment is nothing short of miraculous when one considers the violent world surrounding the city , including its major wars with persia and sparta . in this time of fierce arguments over the future of american(NORP) democracy , we would do well to remember the wisdom of the ancients . law is our greatest protection against tyranny . it is what makes rule by the people possible . and it only works if we the people are committed to it .

? cs=4744(NORP) : 

steve(PERSON) corrie(PERSON) has been big on brahmans(NORP) since he was just 10(DATE) -(DATE) years(DATE) -(DATE) old(DATE) , and has since shared this passion for the breed with his wife zoe and their children , shania , ayla(ORG) ,(ORG) and(ORG) p.j(ORG) .(ORG) 

the corrie family runs their commercial operation across properties they 've owned in gracemere and bouldercombe(ORG) for four(DATE) years(DATE) , while they 've leased breeding country in rannes for three(DATE) years(DATE) , though they 've been leasing cattle country for a(DATE) decade(DATE) in total . 

mr corrie(PERSON) 's parents ran commercial and stud brahman(PERSON) herds(PERSON) , which got him hooked on the breed . he soon began to show and lead their cattle at the rockhampton junior beef show and has been an avid supporter of the brahman since . 

" zoe is really into it now . she 's taken the lead with the brahman herd , while i focus on our angus herd . these two(CARDINAL) herds are run separately , " he said . 

the corries love the brahman for its durability and hardiness . 

" they are a quick responding animal . through the recent hard times with rain , 90(MONEY) per(MONEY) cent(MONEY) of the herd is near on fat . the brahman also seems to turn around quickly with the rain . their natural tick and fly resistance is another plus . " 

mr corrie(PERSON) described their holdings in gracemere and bouldercombe(ORG) , as " better country " , which is under irrigation , which is where they bring their ptic cows and first(ORDINAL) - calf heifers . he said the country on rannes is also good quality , consisting of black soil creek flats to open forestry land , with a mix of green panic to buffel pastures throughout . 

" the rain has been " really good " on the properties close to rockhampton , this(DATE) year(DATE) , but that the rannis block is in dire need of water and grass rain . " 

they leave their brahman bulls with their breeders on a year - round basis . 

" due to us being a smaller operation every calf counts . we 're very hands - on with the cattle , and due to our size , we can wean and brand at any time of the(DATE) year(DATE) that suits us . 

" we 've been rebuilding our herd for the(DATE) last(DATE) two(DATE) years(DATE) . this has included buying in a lot of stud and herd cattle . we also retain the majority of our heifers . we cull hard on any females that do n't test pregnant each(DATE) year(DATE) . there are no second(ORDINAL) chances . this is how we ensure the overall fertility of the herd remains high . " 

mr corrie(PERSON) said they mainly sell steers , through cqlx , straight off their mothers at 180(QUANTITY) to(QUANTITY) 200(QUANTITY) kg(QUANTITY) , so that they can offer a premium product . 

" we 've made a good name for ourselves and have several repeat buyers . " 

while the family had attended the rocky all stars elite brahman female sale for several(DATE) years(DATE) , it was at the 2023(CARDINAL) sale that they made their first(ORDINAL) winning bids on a pair of malabar red brahman heifers . these heifers are close to having their first(ORDINAL) calves to a palmvale bull from remy(PERSON) streeter(PERSON) . 

" we could n't split the two(CARDINAL) so we bought both . their dam , malabar mary , is a great cow . one(CARDINAL) of these heifers was ai and the other was ivf . they 're like two(CARDINAL) peas in a pod despite having different sires . they 're long , fleshy , good doing heifers . 

" when these heifers reach their 40(DATE) -(DATE) day(DATE) cycle , they 'll be ai'd(ORG) with straws we bought out of the imported bull , mr mcc(PERSON) polled smoke 14/9 . the resulting calves will be the first(ORDINAL) polled smoke progeny born in australia(GPE) . " 

mr corrie(PERSON) said the all stars sale holds appeal as each vendor " takes their cream of the crop " heifers . 

" the catalogue is pretty tough to tick standouts in as they 're uniformly top heifers . i 'll be heading back to the sale this(DATE) year(DATE) as there is another malabar mary daughter , that we are keen on . she 's the first(ORDINAL) red by us imported sire m2(PERSON) brc(ORG) captain 518/1(CARDINAL) to be offered in australia(GPE) . " 

he said malabar stud principal tim(PERSON) krause(PERSON) , regularly checks in to see how the heifers are doing . 

" i could n't be happier dealing with tim(PERSON) . the krauses(PERSON) are a great family . "

indonesias - automotive - industry - has - potential - to - grow - bigger - ministry : 

the ministry 's deputy for infrastructure and transportation coordination , rachmat(PERSON) kaimuddin(PERSON) , noted in a statement here on friday(DATE) that based on the world population review data , with a gdp per capita of us$5,000(GPE) , indonesia(GPE) 's car ownership ratio is still relatively low . 

currently , indonesia(GPE) 's car ownership ratio stands at 82(CARDINAL) units per 1,000(CARDINAL) people . 

meanwhile , in thailand(GPE) , with a gdp per capita of us$7,000(PRODUCT) , the car ownership ratio stands at 280(CARDINAL) per 1,000(CARDINAL) people . as for china(GPE) , with a gdp per capita of us$13,000 , the ratio is 221(CARDINAL) units per 1,000(CARDINAL) people . 

" if indonesia(GPE) 's gdp rises to us$10,000(GPE) ( per capita ) in 2030(DATE) , the rate of car ownership can potentially reach 150(CARDINAL) or 200(CARDINAL) units per 1,000(CARDINAL) people , " he remarked . 

he further highlighted that indonesia(GPE) 's automotive industry also has the potential to grow big on account of the fact that it is the biggest vehicle producer and market in southeast(LOC) asia(LOC) .

us driver rescued after crash leaves lorry dangling over side of bridge 

firefighter bryce(PERSON) carden(PERSON) abseiled down and lifted the woman to safety . 

dramatic photos have been released of the rescue of a us(GPE) lorry driver after she crashed off the edge of a bridge . 

the woman was pulled from her cab from over the side of the(ORG) george(ORG) rogers(ORG) clark(ORG) memorial(ORG) bridge(ORG) connecting louisville(GPE) , kentucky(GPE) , to southern indiana(GPE) . 

she was unharmed but three(CARDINAL) other cars were involved in the crash , and two(CARDINAL) people were taken to hospital with possibly life - threatening injuries , according to louisville(GPE) metro police . 

he said the crash occurred when a southbound vehicle hit a stalled car and crossed into northbound traffic , where it struck the lorry and caused it to go through the guardrail and hang precariously off the edge of the bridge . 

the truck was removed from the bridge at around(TIME) 8(TIME) pm(TIME) on friday(DATE) . 

the bridge carries about(CARDINAL) 24,000(CARDINAL) vehicles a day over the(LOC) ohio(LOC) river(LOC) . officials said at a press conference that the bridge is safe and passed an inspection last(DATE) year(DATE) , but acknowledged that its four(CARDINAL) lanes are relatively narrow . 

the accident was reported shortly(TIME) after(TIME) noon(TIME) on friday(DATE) . 

mr(PERSON) greenberg(PERSON) said on saturday(DATE) that he has spoken to the rescued driver , who has not been identified . 

“ she is incredibly brave . she is incredibly fortunate , ” he said . 

kentucky(GPE) ’s state highway engineer james(PERSON) ballinger(PERSON) said on saturday(DATE) that while the bridge will need repairs after the crash , particularly to a pedestrian walkway , its structural integrity was not compromised .

icl - uses - ai - to - help - doctors - assess - lung - cancer - from - virtual - biopsies : 

imperial(ORG) college(ORG) london(ORG) ( icl ) researchers have used artificial intelligence ( ai ) to identify information about the chemical makeup of lung tumours from medical scans of lung cancer . 

published in npj precision oncology , the study demonstrates , for the first(ORDINAL) time , how medical imaging in combination with ai can be used to provide ‘ virtual biopsies ’ for cancer patients . 

responsible for around(CARDINAL) 35,000(CARDINAL) deaths each(DATE) year(DATE) , lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the uk(GPE) . 

supported with funding from the(ORG) national(ORG) institute(ORG) for(ORG) health(ORG) and(ORG) care(ORG) research(ORG) ’s imperial biomedical research centre , the non - invasive method works to classify the type of lung cancer patients have . 

researchers used data from 48(CARDINAL) lung cancer patients recruited from university(ORG) hospital(ORG) reina sofia in spain(GPE) to develop an ai - powered , deep learning assessment tool called tissue - metabolomic - radiomic - ct ( tmr - ct ) . 

using the data , researchers observed a significant correlation between patients ’ metabolomic profiles and the deep features of their ct scans , which appear either brighter or darker in certain areas of the image . 

researchers then used the tmr - ct model in a group of 723(CARDINAL) lung cancer patients recruited from royal marsden hospital , guy ’s and st(PERSON) thomas(PERSON) ’(PERSON) hospital(PERSON) and imperial(ORG) college(ORG) nhs(ORG) healthcare(ORG) trust(ORG) , which showed that tmr - ct successfully classified lung cancer and gave dependable predictions in relation to patient outcomes , surpassing the performance of traditional ct - based methods and clinical assessments . 

the model could help doctors select the right course of treatment for patients and predict whether their cancer is likely to progress . 

researchers also believe that the method could work on other groups of lung cancer patients as well as other types of cancer , including brain , ovarian and endometrial cancers . 

first(ORDINAL) author of the study , marc(ORG) boubnovski(ORG) martell(ORG) , said : “ we ’ve developed a system that merges ct scans with the chemical makeup of tumours and normal lung tissue ” to “ [ allow ] us to classify lung cancer types and … [ provide ] reliable predictions about patient outcomes . ”

safeguard - consumers - from - potentially - dangerous - pain - relief - supplements : 

target : robert(PERSON) califf(PERSON) , commissioner for u.s(GPE) .(GPE) food(ORG) and(ORG) drug(ORG) administration(ORG) 

goal : protect the public from popular supplements that could pose serious health risks . 

two(CARDINAL) recent troubling cases highlight how a lack of regulation in the health supplement industry is possibly endangering consumers ’ lives . for one , scrutiny is increasingly falling on kratom : an herbal supplement found in powder and pill forms and used to relieve pain and anxiety . this substance has reportedly been linked to thousands(CARDINAL) of deaths when taken in combination with other drugs . while the exact nature of the link is still being studied , some researchers believe the supplement may interfere with the body ’s ability to properly break down other drugs . 

another pain supplement , neptune(ORG) ’s fix , has also been associated with potential life - threatening drug interactions and side effects like seizures . this supplement contains an unapproved - for - medical - use ingredient called tianeptine(ORG) . the substance is often referred to as gas station heroin because it is commonly found in gas stations and convenience stores , just like kratom substances ( which are prolific online as well ) . 

the(ORG) u.s(ORG) .(ORG) food(ORG) and(ORG) drug(ORG) administration(ORG) ( fda(ORG) ) has issued warnings about both of these supplements but has done little else to help curb their risk to consumers . despite efforts from organizations like the(ORG) mayo(ORG) clinic(ORG) , the(ORG) drug(ORG) enforcement(ORG) agency(ORG) , and its parent agency the(ORG) department(ORG) of(ORG) health(ORG) and human services to bring greater awareness and action to kratom supplements , the fda(ORG) has reportedly not assisted — and in some cases allegedly obstructed — these efforts . even an advocacy group for kratom agrees that more federal regulation is needed . 

sign the petition below to demand a prominent agency for consumer protection do its job . 

petition letter : 

dear dr . califf(PERSON) , 

warnings will never be sufficient if they do not reach the right ears and eyes . this agency defends its actions on possibly dangerous supplement substances like kratom and tianeptine , but polite requests that businesses stop selling or marketing these products are not sufficient . consumers should directly know of the potential dangers they are facing via clear labeling and warnings . even the(ORG) american(ORG) kratom(ORG) association(ORG) concurs with this assessment . 

a handful of states have already taken the initiative to limit and better regulate supplements such as kratom , and it is far past time for this federal agency to follow suit . please join with the(ORG) drug(ORG) enforcement(ORG) agency(ORG) , the broader department of health and human services , and countless researchers and scientists who are trying to protect consumers from these hidden dangers to their health and their very lives . 

sincerely ,

california(GPE) senate(ORG) candidate rep . katie(PERSON) porter(PERSON) , a consumer advocate , says housing is a top priority 

rep . katie(PERSON) porter(PERSON) 's(PERSON) mistrust of those in power is rooted in what she witnessed , growing up in iowa(GPE) in the(DATE) 1980s(DATE) . 

rep . katie(PERSON) porter(PERSON) 's(PERSON) mistrust of those in power is rooted in what she witnessed , growing up in iowa(GPE) in the(DATE) 1980s(DATE) . 

rep . katie(PERSON) porter(PERSON) 's(PERSON) mistrust of those in power is rooted in what she witnessed , growing up in iowa(GPE) in the(DATE) 1980s(DATE) . 

the race for california(GPE) 's open u.s(GPE) .(GPE) senate(ORG) seat has become a fierce battle between(CARDINAL) three(CARDINAL) democrats(NORP) , some of california(GPE) 's best - known members of congress(ORG) . known as a consumer advocate , congresswoman katie(PERSON) porter(PERSON) is used to fierce battles . in congressional hearings , she has taken on powerful corporate and government leaders using a simple whiteboard to illustrate her arguments . 

porter 's mistrust of those in power is rooted in what she witnessed growing up in iowa(GPE) in the(DATE) 1980s(DATE) . she watched families lose their farms as land values plummeted . at the same time , as iowa(GPE) hosted the first(ORDINAL) - in - the - nation caucuses in presidential politics , she saw candidates campaign throughout the state , making promises they did n't see to keep . 

" so many people lost farms that had been in their family for generations , and there was also a sense of a loss of a future . what would we do here ? there was no economy in a rural area like that , ready to replace it . so we saw people , including my mom , driving 120(QUANTITY) miles(QUANTITY) a day round trip into the nearest city to be able to work . i think a lot of us felt like , ' what will happen to our town ? ' " explained porter . 

years(DATE) later(DATE) , in harvard(ORG) law(ORG) school(ORG) , she heard the same questions as she worked as a research assistant for future sen . elizabeth(PERSON) warren(PERSON) . while warren(PERSON) 's research focused on why families end up in bankruptcy , much of porter 's work was about what happens afterward . she found it 's often 20(DATE) or(DATE) 30(DATE) years(DATE) of continued financial struggle . 

when she became a congresswoman in 2019(DATE) , she says she thought about those families as she got to work . " one(CARDINAL) of my big goals was to make sure that we wrote rules that were fair to consumers , " porter said . " so often those rules are all written to favor big companies . " 

she says that 's why she 's fought to keep corporate money out of politics , including her own campaigns . she says the math is pretty simple . 

" these are some of the most profitable corporations in the world , " porter said . " they would n't make corporate pac donations if they were n't getting a return on their investment in terms of people taking those votes . so it was really important to me right from the beginning to have consumers and workers know that i 'm fighting for them . " 

she is also addressing the political ads that accuse her of taking " donations from executives from big pharma , big oil and big banks . " the ads are paid for by a pac backed mostly by members of the cryptocurrency industry , and independent reviews have called the ads false . specifically , they note the companies named in the ad do n't technically fall under the " big " business categories . 

| related | get the facts : claims in attack ad against california(ORG) senate(ORG) candidate katie(PERSON) porter(PERSON) 

" the simple truth is i 've never taken corporate money , and these special interests know it , " said porter . " i think this is exactly what 's wrong with our politics . " 

porter says in a divided congress(ORG) , trying to pass consumer protections is only part of her work . she believes oversight and enforcement can be even more powerful , like the time she grilled the director of the centers for disease control and prevention , dr . robert(PERSON) redfield(PERSON) . during the pandemic , she convinced him to make covid-19(DATE) testing free for everyone . 

" the law was already on the books to do that . we hear people always talk about what bill they 're going to pass , and that matters , " she explained . " but we also do n't use a lot of the rules and laws that we have . there was already an existing law saying in a public health emergency you can make testing free . " 

before running for congress(ORG) , porter taught at uc(ORG) irvine(ORG) 's(ORG) law school . she 's currently on an extended leave from that job . porter is the only major candidate in this race who 's raising school - aged children . her daughter is 12(DATE) , and her sons are 15(DATE) and(DATE) 18(DATE) years(DATE) old(DATE) . she knows it 's rare for a single mom to talk about those challenges on the campaign trail . 

" the uncertainty of the schedule is actually probably more like most americans(NORP) than what we traditionally have seen in politics , " porter said . " particularly , women elected officials running only after their kids are in college , or after their kids have married and moved out . when i talk about childcare and what this country needs to do , i get it because i 've been that person who 's had that sick kid while i was at work trying to figure out how to manage . " 

porter currently has her sights set on the housing crisis . as a senator , she would push lawmakers to " backstop " private capital , giving developers an incentive to build more affordable housing . like with much of her work , porter says in this race , she 's driven by her hopes for her children 's generation . 

" my own son told me that he does n't think he 's going to live in california(GPE) when he grows up . he 's 15(DATE) . and i asked him why , and he said , ' well , mom , i just think in california(GPE) , you can never afford to buy a house . ' these are real conversations , and they 're about california(GPE) 's future , which is what the senate(ORG) race should be about , " she said . " it 's what congress(ORG) should be working on -- a better future . "

law enforcement officials can not point to a single reason for a disturbing and persistent trend they have witnessed in the(DATE) past(DATE) four(DATE) months(DATE) . 

but all of the cases involve what is literally a pedestrian activity : walking . 

since november(DATE) , at(CARDINAL) least(CARDINAL) 11(CARDINAL) pedestrians in western new(GPE) york(GPE) have died after being hit by a motor vehicle . the fatalities have often happened on busy thoroughfares , but not always . they have involved cars , trucks and motorcycles . 

and they are part of a national trend . according to the(ORG) governors(ORG) highway(ORG) safety(ORG) association(ORG) , the organization that tracks pedestrian deaths nationwide , more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 7,500(CARDINAL) pedestrians were killed by drivers in 2022(DATE) , reaching a 40(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) high . 

a new analysis from 2023(DATE) showed a slight drop in the rates with around 3,373(CARDINAL) pedestrian fatalities in the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) in the(DATE) first(DATE) half(DATE) of(DATE) 2023(DATE) . despite the “ modest 4(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) decrease , ” pedestrian deaths have risen at a steady 14(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) rate since 2019(DATE) .

“ this is a crisis . we are losing 20(CARDINAL) people every(DATE) single(DATE) day(DATE) , ” said adam(PERSON) snider(PERSON) , director of communications at the ghsa(ORG) . 

local communities have been working in recent(DATE) years(DATE) to address the issue of pedestrians being hit while trying to cross busy streets where vehicles can be traveling 40(QUANTITY) mph(QUANTITY) or faster . but the most recent incident occurred on feb(DATE) .(DATE) 21(DATE) , when a woman was struck by a car in the(TIME) early(TIME) morning(TIME) at isherwood(ORG) drive in the town of niagara(GPE) while crossing the street after retrieving her garbage cans . 

other instances include :

- jan . 8 : a pedestrian was killed after being hit by a car on transit road in elma . 

the study by tonawanda(GPE) and amherst(ORG) found there are n’t enough intersections with signals and crosswalks , the road is too dark at night(TIME) and it takes too long for pedestrians to 

cheektowaga(PERSON) saw four(CARDINAL) pedestrian - car crashes in the(DATE) last(DATE) four(DATE) months(DATE) , with at(CARDINAL) least(CARDINAL) two(CARDINAL) fatalities . 

the most recent happened when a man was struck by an suv(ORG) while shoveling snow in front of his losson(ORG) road(ORG) home . amherst(NORP) resident matthew(PERSON) althoff(PERSON) was arrested feb(DATE) .(DATE) 26(DATE) and charged with striking 41(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) -(DATE) old(DATE) antwain hankle and then fleeing the scene of the fatal accident . 

cheektowaga(PERSON) police lt . david(PERSON) vogel(PERSON) said he could not determine a singular cause behind the uptick in the(DATE) recent(DATE) months(DATE) . however , he explained the various measures that are being taken by officials to combat the problem . cheektowaga(PERSON) has applied for and received grant funding from the new(GPE) york(GPE) state governor ’s traffic safety committee for its traffic unit to penalize aggressive driving in problem - prone areas . vogel(ORG) and his team run accident statistics among other data to identify the problem areas before officers conduct targeted roving patrols . 

“ roving patrols plus our joint stationary seatbelt checkpoint with the new(GPE) york(GPE) state police – that ’s probably our biggest step that we take in terms of curbing aggressive driving , pedestrian strikes , traffic fatalities , ” vogel(ORG) said . he also speaks at public events to raise awareness and advise people about traffic safety measures . 

likewise , buffalo police officials say they engage with the public , urging safety and caution , said capt . marcus(PERSON) rogowski(PERSON) and lt . tim(PERSON) o’rourke . simple messages that pedestrians start being taught as children – waiting at the signal before crossing , using crosswalks , wearing lighter , more reflective colors – never stop being important , they said . 

but pedestrians are often not to blame . statistics show that speeding , impaired driving and distracted driving are also common factors . 

“ the increase in speeding since the pandemic , as well as the increased distraction of our electronic devices , those two(CARDINAL) things are ( a ) definite cause behind almost every accident that we have , ” said sgt . amy(PERSON) parisi(PERSON) of the(ORG) erie(ORG) county(ORG) sheriff(ORG) ’s(ORG) office(ORG) 

parisi(ORG) said that patrol officers have started focusing on areas with more pedestrian traffic , especially schools . 

“ transit road has been where some of our fatals have been , ” she said . “ that has been one of our focuses , in past(DATE) years(DATE) , with that ( gtsc(PERSON) ) grant to write tickets for speeding in order to reduce accidents . so that stays on the radar as we focus on where we see those accidents , and we use that grant money to read the tickets in those areas . ” 

increased street lighting , better crosswalks and better designed infrastructure are some other important factors . while three(DATE) -(DATE) quarters(DATE) of the pedestrian fatalities in 2021(DATE) were at night(TIME) , more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) half(CARDINAL) of those occurred in places that had artificial lighting , snider(ORG) said . 

but the only real hope for reversing the trend involves focusing on every possible factor , snider(ORG) said . 

“ these are more than numbers . these are lives , ” snider(ORG) said . “ these ripple effects of grief from even just one(CARDINAL) pedestrian death are fairly incomprehensible , and then you multiply that by 7,500(CARDINAL) . pretty mind - boggling . ”

ellsworth(PERSON) b-21(PERSON) expansion getting mixed support in pierre 

lawmakers from western south(GPE) dakota(GPE) argued that financial support is needed for the airport projects to accommodate the b-21 program and to ensure the long - range viability of the base 

box elder , s.d(PERSON) .(PERSON) — the 2024(CARDINAL) south(GPE) dakota(GPE) legislature considered two(CARDINAL) spending measures for construction projects aimed at preparing for an influx of military personnel and civilians arriving with the launch of the new b-21 raider bomber program at ellsworth(ORG) air(ORG) force(ORG) base(ORG) . 

the state funds were proposed in one(CARDINAL) bill to help build a new elementary school to accommodate rapid student population growth in box elder and through another measure that would include the rapid city regional airport in a funding package to aid expansion of airports across the state . 

in this(DATE) tight(DATE) budget(DATE) year(DATE) , lawmakers rejected the plan to spend up(MONEY) to(MONEY) $(MONEY) 15(MONEY) million(MONEY) to help pay for a new $(MONEY) 60(MONEY) million(MONEY) elementary school in the douglas school district , which serves many families that live and work in and around the base . 

but as the 2024(DATE) legislative session winds down , legislators are still considering a proposal to spend up(MONEY) to(MONEY) $(MONEY) 90(MONEY) million(MONEY) in state funds to offset costs of expansion projects at municipal airports across the state . at the rapid city regional airport , some of it could help pay for $(MONEY) 220(MONEY) million(MONEY) in planned improvements and expansions to prepare for expected large increases in passengers and flights due to the launch of the b-21 program at nearby ellsworth . 

ellsworth(PERSON) was officially chosen in june(DATE) 2021(DATE) as the main base of operations and training location for the air force 's new b-21 raider bomber , a $(MONEY) 700(MONEY) million(MONEY) long - range stealth jet with nuclear capabilities that is intended to replace the b-1b lancer bomber that has been based at ellsworth for years(DATE) .

in pitching the spending packages , lawmakers from western south(GPE) dakota(GPE) argued that state financial support is needed for the school and airport projects to accommodate the b-21 program and to ensure the long - range viability of the base that was nearly closed by the federal government during the base realignment and closure process in 2005(DATE) -(DATE) 2006(DATE) . 

sen . helene(PERSON) duhamel(PERSON) , r - rapid city , sponsored senate(ORG) bill 204(CARDINAL) to help fund the proposed elementary school , starting at a $(MONEY) 15(MONEY) million(MONEY) request and then reducing the ask to $(MONEY) 5(MONEY) million(MONEY) after debate . duhamel(PERSON) reminded members of the(ORG) senate(ORG) education(ORG) committee(ORG) of the harrowing process south(GPE) dakota(GPE) leaders went through in trying to keep ellsworth off the final brac list in 2006(DATE) . " this did not happen by accident , " duhamel testified . " it was hard work , investment with an eye on the future and a willingness to help when needed . it 's time to help again . ” 

ellsworth(PERSON) has obtained greater stability by aggressively seeking new and expanded roles within the air force , landguth(ORG) said . examples include the addition of the air force financial services center at ellsworth in 2007(DATE) , adding the command and control mission for the mq-9 reaper drone program to the base in 2010(DATE) and the 2015(DATE) opening of the 35,000(QUANTITY) -(QUANTITY) square(QUANTITY) -(QUANTITY) mile(QUANTITY) powder river training complex airspace . 

col . derek(PERSON) oakley(PERSON) , commander of the 28th bomb wing at ellsworth , said the air force will embark on nearly(CARDINAL) three(CARDINAL) dozen(CARDINAL) individual construction projects on the base at an estimated cost of $(MONEY) 1.5(MONEY) billion(MONEY) . 

the b-21 program will add more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 4,000(CARDINAL) new military personnel , families and civilian workers to the base over the(DATE) next(DATE) 20(DATE) years(DATE) , bringing the total base population to nearly(CARDINAL) 12,000(CARDINAL) people , oakley(ORG) said . 

the air force projected in its b-21 economic impact statement that development of the new bomber program at ellsworth will create nearly(CARDINAL) 600(CARDINAL) local jobs and almost(MONEY) $(MONEY) 24(MONEY) million(MONEY) in local economic impact . once the bombers arrive , some state officials estimate the program will create an annual(DATE) benefit of $(MONEY) 480(MONEY) million(MONEY) to the state . 

as on - base preparations take off , signs of growth are visible throughout box elder . new houses and apartments are being rapidly constructed , and the town of 12,000(CARDINAL) a few miles east of rapid city has several new businesses already built or in progress . 

oakley(ORG) stressed the importance of ensuring that existing airmen and airwomen(PRODUCT) , as well as the new arrivals , are not overworked or face hardships outside their work lives . 

advertisement 

" it 's a lot to put on their backs for airmen right now , " oakley told news watch in an interview . " our biggest challenge is keeping them engaged and not overworking them . " 

many of those new military personnel have young children , and douglas(PERSON) schools will have an estimated enrollment increase of 1,500(CARDINAL) in the(DATE) next(DATE) 15(DATE) years(DATE) , said superintendent kevin(PERSON) case . 

the district has already spent $(MONEY) 6.2(MONEY) million(MONEY) on planning for the new elementary school , he said . the federal government is expected to pay about(MONEY) $(MONEY) 40(MONEY) million(MONEY) of the $ 60(MONEY) total construction cost . 

but morgan(PERSON) gruebele(PERSON) of the(ORG) state(ORG) bureau(ORG) of(ORG) finance(ORG) and management told senators it would be unfair to provide extra state money to douglas(PERSON) schools when other districts across the state are not receiving it . 

the(ORG) senate(ORG) education(ORG) committee(ORG) passed the bill on a 5(CARDINAL) - 2 vote , but the joint appropriations committee rejected it 11(CARDINAL) - 7 vote . 

as of feb(DATE) .(DATE) 28(DATE) , the proposal to use state funding to expedite expansion of airports statewide still had life in the legislature . 

airport officials told lawmakers the state money is needed because funding from the(ORG) federal(ORG) aviation(ORG) administration(ORG) has been stagnant .

i - lost - son - aggressive - brain-32218915 : 

louise(PERSON) fox(PERSON) , 49(DATE) , from barton(GPE) -(GPE) le(GPE) - clay in bedfordshire(GPE) , lost her son george(PERSON) at the(DATE) age(DATE) of(DATE) 13(DATE) after he was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour . 

she grew close to other mums in the same position and a group of them decided to skydive in memory of their children . they raised thousands(CARDINAL) for brain cancer charity tessa(PERSON) jowell(PERSON) foundation and have plans for another challenge this(DATE) year(DATE) . 

" george(PERSON) was my middle child . he was bright , intelligent and cheeky and the healthiest of my three(CARDINAL) children then , out of the blue , in april(DATE) 2021(DATE) he started complaining of headaches . the doctor and optician said they were just migraines but a(DATE) week(DATE) later(DATE) he vomited and alarm bells started ringing . 

we rushed straight to a&e where they did neurological checks but the headache pattern continued for weeks(DATE) . i put my trust in the doctor who told me point - blank , ' this is n’t a brain tumour . ' a(DATE) few(DATE) weeks(DATE) later(DATE) george(PERSON) and i headed into his scan and we never made it back home . 

they found a 6(QUANTITY) cm(QUANTITY) brain tumour and blue - lighted george to addenbrooke ’s hospital , cambridge(GPE) . our naivety probably saved us at that point . george(PERSON) was as sweet and loving as always . pushing our beds together on the ward , he tried to make it a special time . 

in may , george(PERSON) went in for his 10(TIME) -(TIME) hour(TIME) surgery – we still did n’t know what we were dealing with – but afterwards they said they had removed 99(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) of it . we felt so positive . 

' my world imploded ' 

three(DATE) days(DATE) later(DATE) and george(PERSON) was home but when we went back for the results , our world changed forever . they explained 

that he had a glioblastoma for which there was no cure . they advised us not to go looking for a cure and to enjoy our next 

12(DATE) to(DATE) 15(DATE) months(DATE) that we had left with him . 

i collapsed in the room – my world imploded . we refused to tell george(PERSON) he(PERSON) had an incurable brain tumour . we could n’t tell him he was dying . so we sat at burger king afterwards watching our little boy eat his lunch with his paper crown on , our hearts shattered into pieces . within a(DATE) month(DATE) , his tumour had grown back to full size . 

george(PERSON) went through radiotherapy , chemotherapy , and then immunotherapy in germany(GPE) . we watched our boy have seizures and there was n’t even a 1(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) chance of survival . nearly(DATE) 12(DATE) months(DATE) later(DATE) the same doctor who told us it definitely " was n’t a brain tumour " was the same one who signed his death certificate . 

when you ’re on this journey you turn to parents in support groups – you hope to find someone with a way to help prolong your child ’s life for long enough until a cure is found . you just want to save your child . 

i set up a facebook group called forever mums of brain tumour angels , for mums who had lost children to a brain tumour . 

there ’s about(CARDINAL) 60(CARDINAL) who want to raise awareness . we needed something that felt like a challenge – we were all terrified of heights so this felt right . the skydive was so emotional . we all had t - shirts with our children on and when the second(ORDINAL) plane came down , there was a double rainbow . 

we ’re planning earth , wind and fire next . for earth we ’re climbing snowdonia in may , for wind we ’re going to be wing walking and for fire we ’re going to walk on hot coals . i ’d encourage any mum who has been through what i have to join us – there ’s strength in numbers . we have been through the ultimate pain but we have a responsibility . it powers us through – our children ’s lives ca n’t be in vain .

divisions - appear - in - the - opposition - to - the - opposition - party - levica - after - struggles - to - mobilize - support - for - its - presidential - candidate : 

the populist levica(ORG) party(ORG) was able to capitalize on public anger over the imposed prespa treaty , to win two(CARDINAL) seats in the parliament in the 2020(DATE) elections – which is a rare feat for small parties not aligned with vmro(ORG) -(ORG) dpmne(ORG) or sdsm . 

using the often dramatic speeches and stunts from its two(CARDINAL) representatives , dimitar(GPE) apasiev(GPE) and borislav(PERSON) krmov(PERSON) , the party was hoping to improve this result , and win even a dozen(CARDINAL) seats at the coming general election . but it seems to have fizzed out . 

it ’s presidential candidate , leftist peace activist professor biljana(PERSON) vankovska(PERSON) , struggled for days(DATE) to collect the 10,000(CARDINAL) signatures she needs to enter the race . levica(PERSON) was expecting to accomplish this on the(DATE) first(DATE) day(DATE) , counting on support in skopje(ORG) ’s(ORG) urban(ORG) aerodrom(ORG) district(ORG) and in apasiev ’s hometown of veles(ORG) . 

but the difficulties they faced in collecting signatures came to the surface , particularly in aerodrom(GPE) , and now threaten to divide the party . a prominent local council member , darko(PERSON) maslarkovski(PERSON) , announced that he is leaving the party . “ we face byzantine games , deliberate destruction of the party , distancing of the hard working , honest and feisty activists , and inclusion of spineless , interest driven people . all who showed potential , worked hard and dedicated themselves to the party are being racinized ” , maslarkovski(PERSON) said , referring to socialist poet and icon(ORG) koco(ORG) racin , killed in a “ friendly fire ” incident during world war two(CARDINAL) by a fellow partisan . 

the rapper was immediately denounced by levica(ORG) leadership . member of parliament(ORG) krmov(PERSON) said that maslarkovski(PERSON) was removed from the party , as were the president of the(ORG) karpos(ORG) municipal(ORG) council(ORG) branko(PERSON) ristov(PERSON) , and another karpos(ORG) council(ORG) member . krmov(PERSON) referred to the expelled members as “ taking out the trash ” . 

these disciplinary moves were undertaken to prevent infiltration by structures coordinated by dpmne(ORG) ( vmro(PERSON) ) who are sabotaging the collection of signatures and want to target and contaminate weak links in our membership . these incompeted cadres , who proved not up to the task , will be replaced with new , hard working , honest and loyal workers . three(CARDINAL) crooked ones are leaving , 300(CARDINAL) honest ones will come ! , levica(ORG) said in a statement . 

levica(ORG) was part of the sdsm led colored revolution , which installed zoran(PERSON) zaev(PERSON) as prime minister and went on to impose the name change on macedonia(GPE) . apasiev(PERSON) , a roman law university professor , was even hired as adviser to now disgraced special prosecutor katica(PERSON) janeva(PERSON) , who churned out criminal charges against vmro(ORG) officials that sdsm wanted removed from politics . but after a while , levica(PERSON) took on a different role , declared that they are against the name change , or macedonia(GPE) ’s nato(ORG) membership , and began to accuse sdsm of corruption and betraying macedonia(GPE) ’s national interests , often using rhetoric from the times of the(EVENT) french(EVENT) revolution(EVENT) . its more recent stunts included visiting the grave of albanian(NORP) communist dictator enver(PERSON) hoxha(PERSON) , in an attempt to appeal to albanian(NORP) leftists . 

but in this campaign , the party would often try to edge out vmro(ORG) -(ORG) dpmne(ORG) in the fight for the votes of macedonians(NORP) angry at the national humiliations , leading many in vmro(PERSON) to warn that levica(ORG) are coordinating their actions with sdsm and acting as “ opposition to the opposition ” . levica(PERSON) is also a declared pro(NORP) -(NORP) russian(NORP) party , which again helps sdsm and their partner dui develop talking points about their alleged pro(NORP) -(NORP) european(NORP) stance against the “ russian(NORP) threat ” in macedonia(GPE) , in which sdsm and dui try to lump(PERSON) vmro(PERSON) with levica(ORG) . more recently , the party was seen as coordinating its activities with the mayor of karpos(ORG) stevco(ORG) jakimovski(ORG) , and skopje mayor danela(PERSON) arsovska(PERSON) , who are also trying to run in the elections on platforms accusing vmro(ORG) -(ORG) dpmne(ORG) in ways designed to peel voters from the by far largest opposition party that is the clearly dominant over sdsm in the polls . jakimovski(ORG) is also running for president , and like vankovska(ORG) , is struggling to collect the 10,000(CARDINAL) signatures he needs , indicating that the opposition vote is coalescing around vmro(PERSON) and will not about to miss an opportunity to punish sdsm by voting for the opposition group that has the by far best opportunity to defeat sdsm . 

in fact , sdsm is facing a division of its own . angry with the concessions sdsm is making to bulgaria(GPE) , a large faction centered around the former sdsm stronghold of kumanovo(ORG) split from the party . led by maksim(PERSON) dimitrievski(PERSON) , this(ORG) znam(ORG) party(ORG) had no problem to collect signatures for dimitrievski(ORG) ’s presidential run , and threatens to fragment the sdsm vote to a greater degree than than the damage sdsm hopes levica(ORG) will inflict on vmro(PERSON) . 

vmro(ORG) -(ORG) dpmne(ORG) and sdsm will begin collecting signatures on sunday(DATE) , after their candidates are formally approved by the party institutions . in their case , the question is not whether the task of collecting 10,000(CARDINAL) signatures will be accomplished on the(DATE) first(DATE) day(DATE) , but by how much will they surpass the required number – this will be the gauge of enthusiasm in the two(CARDINAL) largest parties , who can also nominate presidential candidates with 30(CARDINAL) votes in parliament , but always choose to flex their muscles and collect signatures as well .

24156153.man(CARDINAL) - murdered - girlfriend - three(CARDINAL) - relatives - sacrifice - jailed - life : 

a cannabis abuser who claimed he stabbed his girlfriend and three(CARDINAL) of her family members as a “ sacrifice ” has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 46(DATE) years(DATE) for their murders . 

joshua(PERSON) jacques(PERSON) , 29(DATE) , was fuelled by drugs and alcohol when he attacked samantha(PERSON) drummonds(PERSON) and her family with a knife in their home in delaford(GPE) road(GPE) , bermondsey(GPE) , south(GPE) london(GPE) , early on april(DATE) 25(DATE) 2022(DATE) , the old bailey heard . 

police found the bodies of ms drummonds , 27(DATE) , her mother tanysha(PERSON) ofori(PERSON) -(PERSON) akuffo(PERSON) , 45(DATE) , grandmother dolet(GPE) hill(GPE) , 64(DATE) , and ms(PERSON) hill(PERSON) ’s(PERSON) partner , denton(PERSON) burke(PERSON) , 58(DATE) , after being alerted to a disturbance by a neighbour . 

officers found mr burke(PERSON) ’s body at the foot of the stairs and the three(CARDINAL) women “ heaped together ” in the kitchen . 

mr justice bryan(PERSON) said jacques(PERSON) had committed the “ horrific catalogue of murders ” after abusing skunk cannabis . 

addressing jacques(PERSON) in the dock , mr justice bryan(PERSON) said he had inflicted the murders “ in the most brutal of circumstances on three(CARDINAL) generations of the same family ” after increasing his daily(DATE) intake of skunk cannabis . 

he said that jacques(PERSON) ’ offending had been contributed to by cannabis abuse , and that he was “ well aware ” of the impact of it on his mental health . 

he added : “ it is a salutary lesson to all those who peddle the myth that cannabis is not a dangerous drug . 

“ it is , and its deleterious effect on mental health and its potential to cause psychosis is well established . ” 

the court heard that jacques(PERSON) took 3(QUANTITY) g(QUANTITY) of skunk cannabis a day and refused to consider cutting down , saying he would carry on smoking marijuana “ even if it killed ” him . 

jacques(PERSON) appeared emotionless as he was sentenced . 

a cry of “ murderer ” could be heard from the public gallery as he was sent down . 

at the scene , armed officers discovered jacques(PERSON) naked and lying in the upstairs bathroom in a praying position , screaming “ allah , take me ! ” , “ kill me now ” , “ get rid of me ” , and “ god please forgive me ” . 

later , at lewisham(ORG) hospital(ORG) , jacques(PERSON) said : “ i ai n’t even in the wrong , i did them for sacrifice ” , and also warned : “ i will do something stupid again . ” 

paul(PERSON) raudnitz(PERSON) kc(PERSON) , mitigating for jacques(PERSON) at the sentencing hearing , said the attack was not pre - meditated . 

he also read out an apology from his client to the victims ’ families – the first(ORDINAL) time that jacques(PERSON) has expressed remorse for his actions . 

“ i would like to say to the family of the deceased , i am truly and sincerely sorry for all of the anguish , pain and heartache i have caused , ” jacques(PERSON) wrote . 

he added : “ i have discussed it with myself and i can not believe that i am the cause of this monstrosity . ” 

in a victim impact statement , tracey(PERSON) -(PERSON) ann(PERSON) henry(PERSON) , the daughter of ms(ORG) hill(ORG) and the sister of ms(PERSON) ofori(PERSON) -(PERSON) akuffo(PERSON) , said her mother had only just beaten cancer before she was murdered . 

she said her mother had her last radiotherapy session the(DATE) day(DATE) before she was stabbed to death . 

ms(PERSON) henry(PERSON) , who is the aunt of ms(PERSON) drummonds(PERSON) , said : “ how could someone kill four(CARDINAL) people in one(TIME) night(TIME) ? 

“ it is like something from a horror movie . ” 

danny(PERSON) ofori(PERSON) -(PERSON) akuffo(PERSON) , the husband of tanysha(GPE) , said in his impact statement that he had “ cried like a child ” following the incident . 

“ i am a proud man and i have cried like a child in front of so many people , ” he said . 

he described his horror at having to identify his wife ’s body . 

“ i remember wailing out in pain , ” he said . 

“ my heart had shattered into pieces . ” 

jacques(PERSON) admitted manslaughter but denied murder on the basis that he was mentally unwell at the time . 

an old bailey jury deliberated for two(TIME) hours(TIME) to find jacques(PERSON) , from minard(FAC) road(FAC) , lewisham(GPE) , south - east london(GPE) , guilty of four(CARDINAL) counts of murder .

wisconsin(ORG) supreme(ORG) court(ORG) declines to hear congressional maps challenge 

wisconsin(ORG) supreme(ORG) court(ORG) chambers . ( baylor(ORG) spears(ORG) |(ORG) wisconsin(ORG) examiner(ORG) ) 

the(ORG) wisconsin(ORG) supreme(ORG) court(ORG) declined to hear a case challenging the state ’s congressional maps on friday(DATE) , meaning that the current maps will remain the maps for the 2024(CARDINAL) congressional elections . 

the case was filed by a group of democratic(NORP) voters in january(DATE) — shortly after the court ’s decision in december(DATE) 2023(DATE) to throw out the state ’s legislative maps , which led to new maps being passed by the republican(NORP) - led legislature and signed by democratic(NORP) gov . tony(PERSON) evers last(DATE) month(DATE) . the group that filed the case argued that the court ’s decision to overturn the legislative maps should also apply to the state ’s eight(CARDINAL) congressional districts . 

the justices did not explain why they would n’t hear the case in their order . 

conservative justice rebecca(PERSON) bradley(PERSON) said in a concurring opinion , which chief justice annette(PERSON) ziegler(PERSON) joined , that it was n’t surprising that the motion asking them to overturn the congressional maps came before them . 

bradley(ORG) said that the clarke(ORG) v. wisconsin(ORG) elections(ORG) commission(ORG) state legislature redistricting case “ incentivizes litigants to bring politically divisive cases to this court regardless of their legal merit . while the court rightfully denies this motion , it likely wo n’t be long until the new majority flexes its political power again to advance a partisan agenda despite the damage inflicted on the independence and integrity of the court . ” 

the current congressional maps were proposed by gov . tony(PERSON) evers in 2021(DATE) , following a decision by the(ORG) state(ORG) supreme(ORG) courts(ORG) that instructed a “ least change ” approach to drawing maps , meaning any changes needed to be minimal compared to the maps drawn by republicans(NORP) in 2011(DATE) . those maps were chosen by the(ORG) state(ORG) supreme(ORG) court(ORG) for use in the 2022(DATE) elections . the lawsuit argued that the “ least change ” principle continued partisan unfairness that republicans(NORP) introduced to the maps in 2011(DATE) . 

justice janet(PERSON) protasiewicz(PERSON) , who joined the court in august(DATE) 2023(DATE) , did not participate in the case and wrote in a decision friday(DATE) that was because she was not a member of the court when the 2021(DATE) case was decided . 

democrats(NORP) , including evers and u.s(GPE) .(GPE) rep . mark(PERSON) pocan(PERSON) , had supported the lawsuit , agreeing that the maps should be reviewed based on the “ least change ” approach .

death - row - inmate - exonerated-30(DATE) -(DATE) years(DATE) -(DATE) after-1994(DATE) - arson - murder - in - philadelphia(GPE) : 

( philadelphia(GPE) ) — a philadelphia(GPE) man who was convicted and sentenced to death in connection with the 1994(DATE) arson murder of a woman is now exonerated 30(DATE) years(DATE) later(DATE) , the district attorney ’s office announced . 

on wednesday(DATE) , daniel(PERSON) gwynn(PERSON) , 54(DATE) , was exonerated and released from state prison in pennsylvania(GPE) after the da ’s office said they found flaws in the 1994(DATE) first - degree murder investigation . 

“ the exoneration of daniel(PERSON) gwynn(PERSON) today(DATE) frees a man who is likely innocent , ” philadelphia(GPE) district(GPE) attorney larry(PERSON) krasner(PERSON) said in a press release . “ sadly , it also exemplifies an era of inexact and , at times corrupt , policing and prosecution that has broken trust with our communities to this(DATE) day(DATE) . ” 

on november(DATE) 20(DATE) ,(DATE) 1994(DATE) , an unhoused woman named marsha(PERSON) smith(PERSON) was killed after a fire broke out in a vacant building on the 4500(CARDINAL) block of chestnut street in west(GPE) philadelphia(GPE) , according to the press release . 

the da ’s office said smith(GPE) , gwynn(GPE) and three(CARDINAL) other individuals were squatting in the vacant building at the time of the fire . 

a jury trial relied on faulty testimony from two(CARDINAL) witnesses and a confession from gwynn(GPE) , which he recounted and was found inconsistent with how the fire started , according to the release . 

the da ’s office also said gwynn(PERSON) was never read his miranda rights . 

information about an alternate suspect — who was identified by witnesses to police — was never turned over to gwynn(ORG) or presented during his prosecution , which violated his constitutional rights , according to the release . 

the da ’s office says witnesses identified gwynn(ORG) to police as “ rick(PERSON) ” from photo arrays used in a separate murder investigation that took place in the same building three(DATE) days(DATE) before the fire . 

the photo arrays in the police files did not include gwynn(ORG) ’s photo and were never turned over to his defense counsel , according to the release . 

the witnesses who testified in the first(ORDINAL) murder investigation were threatened by the defendant before the fire broke out , which the da ’s office deemed “ critical ” information . 

“ critically , the defendant in the other murder had threatened to have his associates kill the witnesses if they cooperated against him in the other trial , ” the da ’s office said . 

this information was never disclosed to the defense during gwynn(ORG) ’s prosecution , according to the release . 

the defendant in the other case was convicted of first(ORDINAL) - degree murder and sentenced to life in prison , which he is currently serving , the da ’s office said . 

“ the wrongful conviction of daniel(PERSON) gwynn(PERSON) , and his unjust imprisonment for nearly(DATE) three(DATE) decades(DATE) , is a cautionary tale of tunnel vision in policing and prosecution , ” david(PERSON) napiorski(PERSON) , assistant supervisor of federal litigation said in the release . “ not only were mr . gwynn(PERSON) ’s rights violated at trial , but his conviction and sentence to death row likely allowed the person actually responsible to escape accountability . ” 

napiorski(PERSON) apologized to marsha(PERSON) smith(PERSON) ’s family “ for the retraumatization they have likely experienced . ” 

“ they were deprived of justice in 1994(DATE) and are deserving of justice now , ” napiorski(PERSON) said . 

during his time in prison , gwynn(PERSON) used painting as an outlet “ to heal and survive ” and shared his work via the website , art for justice , which exhibits prisoners ’ artwork . 

“ painting has been my therapy , a form of meditation that helps me work through my issues , ” gwynn(PERSON) wrote alongside his paintings . 

gwynn(ORG) said art allowed him to not only work on himself but also his legal case . 

“ my transformation came about after i was forced to sit still and take a real hard look at myself , ” gwynn(PERSON) wrote . “ after i worked through the garbage in my head , i finally woke up and began to work on myself and my case . ”

baltimore(GPE) - schools - david - smith - lawsuit : 

baltimore(GPE) city(GPE) schools seeks to scrutinize a media owner , a local tv station and a limited liability company in its defense against a sweeping civil lawsuit . 

david(PERSON) smith(PERSON) , the executive chairman of sinclair(ORG) broadcasting(ORG) group(ORG) who recently purchased the baltimore sun , has been subpoenaed to testify about his involvement in the taxpayer suit against baltimore(GPE) city(GPE) and its school system . sinclair(ORG) broadcasting(ORG) group(ORG) and the limited liability company smith(ORG) ’s associated with , election law integrity , were named as interested parties in the case after plaintiff jovani(PERSON) patterson(PERSON) revealed that the entity was paying his legal bills . 

smith(PERSON) ’s deposition was originally scheduled for monday(DATE) , according to court documents , but that ’s likely to change , a city schools spokesperson said . 

patterson(PERSON) and his wife brought the civil lawsuit in january(DATE) 2022(DATE) , claiming the district defrauded taxpayers by failing to educate its students , inaccurately reporting student enrollment and not enforcing truancy rules . the pattersons , who live in west(GPE) baltimore(GPE) and whose child attended a city public school before transferring to a baltimore(GPE) county(GPE) private school , filed a taxpayer suit in baltimore(ORG) circuit(ORG) court(ORG) . 

this suit seeks to have the court impose oversight on the school system . 

city attorneys tried to dismiss the case in 2022(DATE) , arguing students ’ education should n’t be regulated through litigation that seeks to hold the school system to an undefined standard . patterson(PERSON) ’s complaint is “ ill - intentioned and frivolous , ” city attorneys wrote , and “ focuses on every catchy headline published by fox 45(CARDINAL) in the(DATE) past(DATE) several(DATE) years(DATE) that is critical of [ city schools ] . ” 

in response to issues raised by the complaint , the school district said in court documents that it “ had identified through its own protocols limited instances of misconduct undertaken by a limited number of employees . ” 

a judge allowed the case to move forward . 

thomas(PERSON) &(PERSON) libowitz(PERSON) , the firm representing patterson(PERSON) , also was called to testify about their involvement . city attorneys requested documents and records of communication that smith(ORG) , election law integrity and the law firm have had with each other and sinclair(ORG) , which owns fox 45(CARDINAL) . patterson(PERSON) is a frequent guest on fox 45(CARDINAL) newscasts , which has covered the case . patterson(PERSON) ’s complaint includes fox 45(CARDINAL) articles about the school system to support his claims . 

margaret(PERSON) argent(PERSON) , an attorney at thomas(ORG) &(ORG) libowitz(ORG) who represents patterson(PERSON) , objected to the request . 

“ the document request do not even make mention of the specific facts that will be issue at trial , ” she wrote . bcpss “ is concerned about the fact that the plaintiff ’s legal fees are being paid by a third(ORDINAL) party . ” 

patterson(PERSON) and smith(PERSON) , who lives in baltimore(GPE) county(GPE) , have been publicly linked to several past political initiatives . but smith(PERSON) ’s involvement in the bcpss lawsuit was not reported until patterson(PERSON) was deposed in january(DATE) , more(DATE) than(DATE) two(DATE) years(DATE) after the suit was filed . patterson(PERSON) told school attorneys he had several meetings with smith(ORG) at(ORG) sinclair(ORG) ’s(ORG) headquarters in hunt(LOC) valley(LOC) and thomas(ORG) &(ORG) libowitz(ORG) ’s baltimore(GPE) office before hiring the firm and filing the suit in 2022(DATE) . thomas(PERSON) &(PERSON) libowitz(PERSON) has previously represented smith(ORG) and(ORG) sinclair(ORG) . 

“ david(PERSON) smith(PERSON) ’s(PERSON) apparent and previously undisclosed hands - on involvement in the patterson litigation leads to many questions , notably the authentic intent of the litigation , ” sherry christian(NORP) , a city schools spokesperson , said in a statement . “ the best way for the public to know the truth is for mr . smith(PERSON) and fox 45 to do what the tv station often seems to demand — be transparent . ” 

smith(PERSON) did not respond to requests for comment through a spokesperson . thomas(PERSON) &(PERSON) libowitz(PERSON) did not respond to a request for comment . 

attorneys for smith(PERSON) and election law integrity objected to the subpoenas , calling them overly burdensome and unrelated to enrollment , truancy and other issues of the case . a judge has yet to rule on the objections . 

taxpayer lawsuits are brought by citizens living in a jurisdiction challenging that the government misused their money . however , they can be considered as activist lawsuits aimed at publicizing a particular legal issue , said cary(PERSON) hansel(PERSON) , a baltimore(GPE) civil rights attorney . 

“ activist lawsuits are not always focused on success in the courtroom but sometimes filed for the purpose of shining a light on an issue in the most noble cases , or harassing an opponent in the rare unfortunate case , ” hansel(ORG) said . 

in his january(DATE) deposition , patterson(PERSON) testified that he had n’t paid any legal fees in the case . rather , election law integrity , in which smith(PERSON) is a “ representative , ” has been paying thomas(ORG) &(ORG) libowitz(ORG) ’s(ORG) legal fees , argent(ORG) said . 

bcpss(ORG) subpoenaed(ORG) smith(ORG) and election law integrity nine(DATE) days(DATE) after patterson(PERSON) ’s deposition . an attorney at thomas(ORG) &(ORG) libowitz(ORG) and the firm itself are listed as the resident agents of election law integrity . 

patterson(PERSON) testified that he was introduced to smith(PERSON) through julian(NORP) baron , a producer at sinclair(ORG) , when patterson(PERSON) was running as a republican(NORP) for baltimore(GPE) city council president in 2020(DATE) . the three(CARDINAL) men met at sinclair(ORG) ’s(ORG) headquarters on at(CARDINAL) least(CARDINAL) three(CARDINAL) occasions before patterson(PERSON) said he decided in late(DATE) 2021(DATE) to sue the city and its schools . 

smith(PERSON) joined patterson(PERSON) and his wife for two(CARDINAL) meetings with attorneys before patterson(PERSON) signed a retainer agreement with thomas(ORG) &(ORG) libowitz(ORG) , patterson(PERSON) said . 

in 2022(DATE) , patterson(ORG) and(ORG) smith(PERSON) joined forces on a successful ballot initiative that created term limits for baltimore(PERSON) ’s mayor , comptroller and city council . 

patterson(PERSON) chairs the political action committee people for elected accountability and civic engagement , a group that petitioned to put the issue of term limits on city ballots . smith(PERSON) provided money to finance the effort , as well as an unsuccessful attempt to ask voters to establish recall elections . state records show smith(PERSON) gave $ 560,000(MONEY) to the committee in 2022(DATE) . term limits were overwhelmingly approved by voters that same(DATE) year(DATE) . 

smith(PERSON) and patterson(PERSON) are teaming up once again ahead of the 2024(DATE) election , this time to petition for a ballot question that would cut the size of the baltimore city council in half(CARDINAL) . public records show smith(PERSON) gave the committee $ 340,000(MONEY) last(DATE) year(DATE) . the group already has submitted more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 25,000(CARDINAL) signatures to the board of elections , more than what ’s required to place the question a place on the november(DATE) ballot .

teslas - supercharger - network - continues - to - secure - partnerships - but - competition - is - coming : 

it 's no secret that tesla(ORG) inc(ORG) .(ORG) is the cream of the electric vehicle ( ev ) industry crop . and that does n't just hold true with its vehicles . the company is also known for its growing supercharger network . 

while tesla continues to secure partnerships for the future , there are a handful of startups looking to disrupt the industry . for example , dunamis(NORP) charge is addressing affordability and accessibility barriers to ev adoption in urban communities . the startup and others are playing catchup , but with a niche approach , there 's plenty of market share to go around . 

bp and ford(ORG) : new tesla partnerships 

bp(ORG) plc(ORG) is making significant strides in the electric vehicle charging sector with a $(MONEY) 100(MONEY) million(MONEY) purchase of supercharger hardware from tesla . the groundbreaking deal marks the first(ORDINAL) instance of tesla ’s dc fast - charging equipment being acquired for use in a third(ORDINAL) - party charging network . 

the purchase is intended for bp ’s ev charging business bp pulse , which is investing up(MONEY) to(MONEY) $(MONEY) 1(MONEY) billion(MONEY) to develop a nationwide charging network by 2030(DATE) . 

the tesla superchargers , capable of charging at up to 250kw(FAC) , are equipped with a magic dock connector . this allows compatibility with the standardized north(NORP) american(NORP) charging standard ( nacs ) plug from tesla and a ccs combo attachment that supports most other ev models . 

bp pulse ’s expansion plans include installing these chargers starting in 2024(DATE) across various locations , such as travelcenters of america , thorntons(GPE) , ampm(GPE) , amoco(ORG) as well as third(ORDINAL) - party locations like hertz rental car sites . key cities like houston(GPE) , phoenix(GPE) , los(GPE) angeles(GPE) , chicago(GPE) and washington(GPE) , d.c(GPE) .(GPE) , are slated for the initial rollout . with over 27,000(CARDINAL) charging stalls already installed , bp pulse aims to increase this number to over(CARDINAL) 100,000(CARDINAL) globally by 2030(DATE) . 

in a related development , ford(ORG) motor(ORG) co.(ORG) announced plans to incorporate more of tesla ’s superchargers into its electric - vehicle charging network , exceeding previous forecasts . ford(ORG) will add over(CARDINAL) 15,000(CARDINAL) tesla superchargers to its network , an increase from an earlier projection of 12,000(CARDINAL) . 

this expansion is part of ford(ORG) ’s strategy to grow its blueoval charge network in north(LOC) america(LOC) by 25(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) , bringing the total to over(CARDINAL) 106,000(CARDINAL) chargers . 

ford(ORG) ’s integration of the chargers is seen as a positive move for ev owners , who have long considered the availability of charging stations a major barrier to ev adoption . ford(ORG) has also partnered with three(CARDINAL) new charging providers — francis energy , blink charging and red e charge — in the u.s(GPE) .(GPE) and canada(GPE) , adding over 10,000(CARDINAL) new chargers , including more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 550(CARDINAL) new dc fast chargers , to its network . 

ford(ORG) ’s collaboration with tesla to allow access to its extensive supercharger network signifies a major milestone in the ev industry . the partnership , formalized months(DATE) ago(DATE) , also makes ford(ORG) the first(ORDINAL) major automaker to adopt tesla ’s proprietary charging standard .

minnesota(GPE) - vikings - garrett - bradbury(GPE) - out - job - next : 

longtime vikings offensive starter could be out of a job next 

by adam(PERSON) patrick(PERSON) 

following the report of the minnesota(GPE) vikings releasing running back alexander(PERSON) mattison(PERSON) , could center garrett bradbury(GPE) be the next guy on his way out of town ? 

despite a disappointing performance from him in 2023(DATE) , some minnesota(GPE) vikings fans were caught a bit off guard when espn(PERSON) 's adam(PERSON) schefter(PERSON) shared the news on thursday(DATE) that the team is releasing running back alexander(PERSON) mattison(PERSON) after five(DATE) seasons(DATE) with the franchise . 

moving on from mattison(ORG) will reportedly create $(MONEY) 3.35(MONEY) million(MONEY) in cap space for the vikings , as they were able to part with him before a guarantee in his contract kicked in on march(DATE) 15(DATE) . 

after the news of minnesota(GPE) 's plans to release the veteran running back was revealed on thursday(DATE) , it got some people thinking about another veteran member of the team 's 2023(DATE) offense who could be let go in the near future . 

will garrett(PERSON) bradbury(PERSON) be the next veteran cut by the minnesota(GPE) vikings ? 

similar to the guarantee that was going to be locked in on march(DATE) 15(DATE) in mattison(PERSON) 's contract , current vikings(ORG) center(ORG) garrett(ORG) bradbury(ORG) also has a trigger in his current deal that could result in the team cutting him before the start of free agency . 

on march(DATE) 15(DATE) , bradbury(GPE) 's base salary of $(MONEY) 4.65(MONEY) million(MONEY) will become fully guaranteed , according to overthecap.com . his contract is n't exactly super expensive , but he has n't exactly performed well during his tenure with minnesota(GPE) , either . 

in 2022(DATE) , bradbury(GPE) actually finished with the 11th(ORDINAL) - best offensive grade from pff among qualifying centers in the nfl(ORG) . this(DATE) past(DATE) season(DATE) , however , that pff offensive grade dropped down to 23rd among qualifying centers . 

even if bradbury(GPE) 's contract is deemed affordable , the vikings could still use the money they would save from cutting him to bring in a better - performing center . 

there are a number of intriguing centers who are expected to be available in free agency this(DATE) year(DATE) , including connor(PERSON) williams(PERSON) , andre(PERSON) james(PERSON) , and lloyd(PERSON) cushenberry(PERSON) iii(PERSON) . 

all three(CARDINAL) of these pending free agents received an offensive grade from pff in 2023(DATE) that ranked 10th(ORDINAL) - best or better among qualifying centers . in fact , a total of six(CARDINAL) centers who are expected to be available in free agency this(DATE) year(DATE) all earned a better offensive grade from pff last(DATE) season(DATE) than bradbury(GPE) . 

minnesota(GPE) is already parting ways with mattison , so it 's clear they were n't happy with their rushing attack last(DATE) season(DATE) . could bradbury(GPE) , who had pff 's 21st(ORDINAL) - best run block grade among centers in 2023(DATE) , be the next player the vikings look to move on in order to improve their run game before the(DATE) 2024(DATE) season(DATE) ?

texas(GPE) - sen - cornyn - announces - run - for - gop(ORG) - leader - as - scramble - to - succeed - mcconnell - begins - in - the - senate : 

washington(GPE) — texas(GPE) sen . john(PERSON) cornyn(PERSON) has informed his colleagues that he intends to run for senate(ORG) republican(NORP) leader , becoming the first(ORDINAL) senator to announce a campaign after sen . mitch(PERSON) mcconnell(PERSON) said he will step down from the post in november(DATE) . 

cornyn(PERSON) , who served as mcconnell(PERSON) ’s no . 2(CARDINAL) in leadership before he was term - limited out of the job five(DATE) years(DATE) ago(DATE) , is citing his experience in that role in a statement thursday(DATE) to fellow senators announcing his run . but he also is trying to distinguish himself from mcconnell(PERSON) , saying , “ i believe the senate(ORG) is broken — that is not news to anyone . ” 

“ from experience , i have learned what works in the senate(ORG) and what does not , ” cornyn(PERSON) said . “ and i am confident senate(ORG) republicans(NORP) can restore our institution to the essential role it serves in our constitutional republic . ” 

there has long been speculation that cornyn(GPE) , south(GPE) dakota(GPE) sen(GPE) . john(PERSON) thune(PERSON) and wyoming(PERSON) sen(PERSON) . john(PERSON) barrasso(PERSON) — the “ three(CARDINAL) johns ” — would vie to replace mcconnell(PERSON) , r(ORG) -(ORG) ky(ORG) .(ORG) , if and when mcconnell(PERSON) were to step down . but the longtime leader ’s surprise announcement on wednesday(DATE) that he wo n’t run again for republican(NORP) leader after the november(DATE) elections has jump - started the campaign earlier than expected , almost(DATE) nine(DATE) months(DATE) before gop(ORG) senators are expected to gather and choose a new leader behind closed doors . 

cornyn(ORG) , a former texas(GPE) attorney general who was first(ORDINAL) elected to the senate(ORG) in 2002(DATE) , is a prominent member of the(ORG) senate(ORG) judiciary(ORG) committee(ORG) and a popular member of the gop(ORG) conference who is seen as a steady hand . he has managed to bridge some of the caucus ’ deep divides in recent(DATE) years(DATE) while also occasionally negotiating with democrats(NORP) , as he did on bipartisan gun legislation in 2022(DATE) . 

he is also a prolific fundraiser for the party , having raised a total of $(MONEY) 13(MONEY) million(MONEY) for incumbents , the party ’s senate(ORG) campaign arm , and senate(ORG) republican(NORP) nominees already in the 2024(DATE) cycle . 

in his statement , cornyn(PERSON) said he believes he has “ built a track record of listening to colleagues and seeking consensus , while leading the fight to stop bad policies that are harmful to our nation and the conservative cause . ” 

cornyn(PERSON) said he would work to improve communication , try to move spending bills individually and make an effort to include every member in decisions . that ’s a response to frequent complaints from some senators about massive year(DATE) -(DATE) end(DATE) spending bills and mcconnell(PERSON) ’s top - down leadership approach . 

both thune(GPE) , the current no . 2(CARDINAL) republican(NORP) , and barrasso(GPE) , the chairman of the senate(ORG) gop(ORG) conference , have left the door open to runs after mcconnell(PERSON) ’s announcement . neither has officially announced a campaign for the job . 

thune(PERSON) told reporters that mcconnell(PERSON) ’s departure leaves “ big shoes to fill , ” but that now is a time “ to reflect on his service and and honor him for that . and then we ’ll we ’ll go from there . ” after cornyn(PERSON) ’s announcement , a spokesman for thune(ORG) said the senator is reaching out to colleagues to discuss “ the future of the senate(ORG) republican(NORP) conference and what they would like to see in their next leader , ” but intends on keeping those conversations private . 

barrasso(PERSON) said wednesday(DATE) he ’s focused on the november(DATE) election and getting a senate(ORG) majority . in terms of leadership decisions , “ i ’m going to talk to members of the conference , hear what they have to say , listen to them in terms of what direction they want to take . ” 

much of the race for leader is likely to take place through phone calls , one(CARDINAL) - on - one(CARDINAL) meetings and private gatherings over the(DATE) next(DATE) several(DATE) months(DATE) . unlike the house , where both parties vote for speaker in a public — and recently messy — spectacle , senate(ORG) party(ORG) leadership is chosen in closed - door conference meetings by secret ballot . cornyn(PERSON) was already making calls and reaching out to his fellow senators in the(TIME) hours(TIME) since mcconnell(PERSON) ’s announcement . 

republican(NORP) senators have n’t chosen a new leader since 2007(DATE) , when mcconnell(PERSON) was elected . that ’s before most current gop(ORG) senators took office . 

it is unclear which of the three(CARDINAL) “ johns(PERSON) ” would have an advantage among their peers . 

while cornyn(PERSON) is well liked and has drawn attention for his fundraising , thune(GPE) could have the advantage of incumbency , as mcconnell(PERSON) ’s current deputy . barrasso(PERSON) has tracked furthest to the right of the three(CARDINAL) , becoming the first(ORDINAL) of them to endorse former president donald(PERSON) trump(PERSON) for the gop(ORG) presidential nomination . 

thune and cornyn(PERSON) have criticized trump in the past , especially since the jan(DATE) .(DATE) 6(DATE) ,(DATE) 2021(DATE) , attack on the capitol by trump(PERSON) ’s supporters . but each eventually endorsed him as it became more likely that he will be the party ’s presidential nominee this(DATE) year(DATE) . 

[ senate(ORG) republicans(NORP) will face leadership struggle between trump and mcconnell(PERSON) camps ] 

there are certain to be other candidates , as well , including from the wing of the party that is closest to trump . 

florida(GPE) sen . rick(PERSON) scott(PERSON) challenged mcconnell(PERSON) in 2022(DATE) at trump(GPE) ’s urging , winning 10(CARDINAL) votes , and he could run again . scott(PERSON) has said he is focused on his own reelection bid this(DATE) year(DATE) , but has appeared open to a run after that . 

“ i think there ’s a better way to run the senate(ORG) , ” scott(PERSON) said after mcconnell(PERSON) ’s announcement . “ so we ’ll see what happens . ” 

on thursday(DATE) , scott(PERSON) said that he and sen . ron(PERSON) johnson(PERSON) , r - wisc . , will soon call for a special conference meeting to discuss the future of the party . 

the sudden scramble for the next leader comes as mcconnell(PERSON) , 82(DATE) , had faced louder and increasing criticism from some within his party who have said it is time for a change in leadership . they have criticized mcconnell(PERSON) ’s support for the huge end - of - year spending bills and , most recently , his outspoken backing for aid for ukraine(GPE) . a growing number in his conference has opposed the assistance , saying it would be better spent on the u.s.-mexico border or elsewhere within the u.s(GPE) .(GPE) 

the republican(NORP) leader was also at odds with trump , whom he has said was " practically and morally responsible " for the capitol attack . the two(CARDINAL) have n’t spoken since before then , and trump frequently bashes him publicly . 

mcconnell(PERSON) acknowledged his critics in his senate(ORG) floor speech announcing that he would step down from that role . 

“ believe me , i know the politics within my party at this particular moment in time , ” mcconnell(PERSON) said . “ i have many faults , misunderstanding politics is not one of them . ” 

he also echoed his critics , calling for a “ new generation ” to take over . 

in the(TIME) hours(TIME) after the announcement , as the surprise wore off , many senators praised mcconnell(PERSON) ’s legacy , including his role in the senate(ORG) confirmation of three(CARDINAL) conservative supreme(ORG) court(ORG) justices who tilted the court to the right . 

others were more focused on the future . 

“ this is a good development , ” said missouri(PERSON) sen(PERSON) . josh(PERSON) hawley(PERSON) , a frequent mcconnell(PERSON) critic . “ my question is : why wait so long ? ”

bear - burgers - opening : 

bear(ORG) burgers(ORG) is the newest culinary addition to mercer village . but it is more than just a restaurant ; it ’s a testament to resilience , community support and the pursuit of a dream . 

founded by jonathan(PERSON) and stephanie(PERSON) keene(PERSON) , this eatery emerged amid adversity , transforming setbacks into opportunities to create something truly special . the two(CARDINAL) faced homelessness at one(CARDINAL) point , but their grit and tenacity have been instrumental in creating multiple businesses . 

the journey to bear burger ’s began with “ keene ’s kafe(GPE) , ” a humble eatery tucked away in a shell gas station on thomaston road . the keenes faced challenges , including a summer(DATE) burglary that threatened the business ’s future . after the incident , there was an outpour of support from the community which played a pivotal role in shaping bear burger ’s destiny , jonathan(PERSON) keene(PERSON) said . 

“ a lot of the community supported me and wanted to see me open up a standalone location somewhere nearby . they knew as well as i did that that was n’t going to happen after the robbery , " keene said . " so generally speaking , that brought in a lot of support . my whole business model is if you love on people and treat them right , they got your back . ” 

this motivated the pair to move elsewhere . inspired by a desire to provide a welcoming space for mercer students , the couple opened the restaurant this(DATE) january(DATE) . 

“ when i was looking for where i thought a restaurant could make the most impact in macon , my wife and i came over to the mercer area and noticed there were no restaurant areas specifically tailored for mercer students , ” keene(PERSON) said . 

for keene , it was the unwavering support of the community , particularly the mercer community , that fueled their determination to persevere . recognizing the need for a dedicated space catering to mercer students , keene(PERSON) envisioned a new venture that would not only provide food but also cultivate a sense of belonging . 

“ this business is theirs . there is nowhere on or near campus , to me , where you can be a mercer student and feel more welcomed , positive , and cared for right when you walk in here . bear burgers , to me , will become a part of the mercer experience , ” keene(PERSON) said . 

beyond serving food , keene notes that he is dedicated to giving back to the mercer community . 

“ we are keying out ideas right now where every month , we ’ll have a competition where any student club , fraternity , or organization that is involved with a charity – however many people that they get to come here and eat that(DATE) month(DATE) , we ’ll give them 10(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) to their charity , ” keene(PERSON) said . 

as the restaurant continues to grow , jon(PERSON) and stephanie(PERSON) are excited for their time in mercer(GPE) village(GPE) .

quadruple-murder-refutes-myth-cannabis-183506192.html : 

quadruple murder refutes ‘ myth ’ that cannabis is safe , judge says 

- oops!something went wrong.please try again later . 

the case of a marijuana addict who murdered four(CARDINAL) people in a psychotic frenzy should be taken as a “ lesson to all those who peddle the myth that cannabis is not a dangerous drug ” , a judge has said . 

joshua(PERSON) jacques(PERSON) , 29(DATE) , stabbed to death his girlfriend , samantha(PERSON) drummonds(PERSON) , 27(DATE) , and three(CARDINAL) of her family members : mother tanysha(PERSON) ofori(PERSON) -(PERSON) akuffo(PERSON) , 45(DATE) , grandmother dolet(GPE) hill(GPE) , 64(DATE) , and her husband denton(PERSON) burke(PERSON) , 58(DATE) , in bermondsey(GPE) , south - east london(GPE) , on april(DATE) 25(DATE) 2022(DATE) . 

jacques(PERSON) butchered all four(CARDINAL) within the space of a single evening following a bout of “ self - intoxication ” with drugs and alcohol . 

prosecutors , during the trial in december(DATE) at the old bailey , described the scene as a “ bloodbath ” that would not have looked out of place in a horror film . 

immediately after the murders , jacques(PERSON) video(PERSON) -(PERSON) called his mother from a locked bathroom , telling her : “ i ’m ending it , i ’m gon na make a sacrifice . ” 

armed police who arrived at the scene were met with the sight of jacques(PERSON) naked and prostrate on the ground in a praying position , shouting , “ allah , take me ” , “ kill me now , ” “ get rid of me , ” and “ god please forgive me ” . 

on friday(DATE) , justice bryan(PERSON) handed the killer four(CARDINAL) life sentences with a minimum of 46(DATE) years(DATE) for the “ horrific catalogue of murders inflicted on three(CARDINAL) generations of the same family ” . 

‘ psychosis ’ 

the court heard how jacques(PERSON) had smoked cannabis since the(DATE) age(DATE) 12(DATE) and had doubled his consumption in the(DATE) week(DATE) running up to the killings . 

justice bryan(PERSON) , in sentencing , said : “ the tragedy that played out on 25(CARDINAL) april(DATE) 2022(DATE) is a salutary lesson to all those who peddle the myth that cannabis is not a dangerous drug . 

“ no one is suggesting that [ the murders ] were religiously motivated . you never intended to make any sacrifices of your victims . this was simply a symptom of your psychosis . 

“ you were well aware of the risks to your health of smoking skunk cannabis . you had doubled your consumption of cannabis in the(DATE) weeks(DATE) leading up to the killings . 

“ you may have consumed seven(QUANTITY) grams(QUANTITY) of cannabis a day immediately before the killing . ” 

dr(PERSON) nigel(PERSON) blackwood(PERSON) , a forensic psychiatrist for the prosecution , said the symptoms of manic behaviour displayed were caused by the large amount of cannabis jacques(PERSON) had consumed . 

jacques(PERSON) had been hospitalised in a psychiatric ward in 2018(DATE) and diagnosed with bipolar disorder . 

he had denied four(CARDINAL) counts of murder , but jurors convicted him on each charge after a trial last(DATE) december(DATE) . 

explaining his decision not to impose a whole - life sentence , justice bryan(PERSON) said jacques(PERSON) was unlikely to pose the same risk to the public in his(DATE) seventies(DATE) . 

“ a very substantial minimum term will amount to a just punishment , ” he said . 

previous convictions 

the court heard jacques(PERSON) has 11(CARDINAL) convictions for 20(CARDINAL) offences , including conspiracy to supply drugs . 

paul(PERSON) raudnitz(PERSON) kc(PERSON) , defending , claimed there was no “ premeditation ” before jacques(PERSON) carried out the murders . 

“ the critical distinction between this case and those where the court would see fit to say that a whole - life sentence is merited is an absence of premeditation . ” 

mr raudnitz(PERSON) read a note to the court in which jacques(PERSON) apologised for what he had done . 

“ i would like to say to the family of the deceased that i am truly and sincerely sorry for all the heartache i have caused them . 

“ i am disgusted with myself . i can not believe that i am the cause of this monstrosity . ”

dripping springs isd(ORG) ’s response to playground sexual assault upsets parent 

editor ’s note : this story features an account of alleged sexual assault against minors . kxan(GPE) has withheld the names and identifying information for the privacy of those involved . if you are in distress or need someone to talk to , please call rainn(PERSON) ’s national sexual assault hotline at 1(CARDINAL) -(CARDINAL) 800(CARDINAL) -(CARDINAL) 656(CARDINAL) -(CARDINAL) 4673(CARDINAL) . 

dripping(PERSON) springs(PERSON) , texas(GPE) ( kxan(GPE) ) — a dripping springs isd(ORG) mother describes an oct(DATE) .(DATE) 20(DATE) family dinner with her elementary student in heart - breaking detail . 

during nightly(TIME) family dinners , she , her husband and children do “ highs and lows ” — each tells the others about the best moment and worst moment from their(DATE) day(DATE) . 

“ i do n’t have a high for the(DATE) day(DATE) , ” said one(CARDINAL) of her children . 

“ we kept calm in the moment , ” said the mom , after learning her child ’s low for the(DATE) day(DATE) . “ i just kept thinking , ‘ what the f — happened to them ? ' ” 

the incident 

according to the mom , her child and another student were both on the playground at recess . she believes five(CARDINAL) teachers and more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 100(CARDINAL) other students were also on the large playground . security cameras were mounted around the area to monitor the students . 

the two(CARDINAL) students , who knew each other from prior grades , were under a play structure and visible to teachers and cameras , according to the mom . 

“ we ’re going to play vet , ” said the other student . 

according to the mom , her child said that ’s when the other student reached into her child ’s pants . the mom said that the other student then sexually assaulted her child . 

her child told their parents that they told a teacher , but the mom said no one from the school contacted her . she said they only learned what happened when her child told the family during dinner . 

after checking their child for injuries , the mom said they contacted a pediatrician , a child psychologist and the school . since the incident , she said their child has received medical care and therapy . 

the investigation 

the school responded to the mom the(DATE) next(DATE) day(DATE) . it told her that a “ stay away ” order was put in place for the two(CARDINAL) students and that it verbally communicated the order to relevant teachers and staff . 

the parents and school administrators met on oct(DATE) .(DATE) 23(DATE) . the mom said school officials presented two(CARDINAL) options at that meeting : an internal investigation by the school district or a title ix complaint investigation . the mom said school officials told them that if a title ix complaint was filed , then details about what happened and the names of everyone involved would be public information . 

the mom said they filed a title ix complaint on the(DATE) same(DATE) day(DATE) . 

kxan(GPE) has filed a public information request for more information on the title ix investigation . 

the mom said that on nov(DATE) .(DATE) 7(DATE) , investigators interviewed the two(CARDINAL) students and another child who had witnessed what happened . according to the mom , those interviews corroborated her child ’s story . she also said that the district deemed video footage “ too grainy ” to tell what happened , but it also could n’t show them the footage , saying it had automatically been deleted after 16(DATE) days(DATE) . 

according to the mom , the investigation closed on nov(DATE) .(DATE) 20(DATE) and concluded that the other child did sexually assault her child . 

“ this happened in broad daylight , ” the mom said . “ where were the teachers ? is anyone being held accountable ? is anyone looking into the other student ’s safety ? ” 

jennifer(PERSON) edwards(PERSON) , the executive director of communication with dripping springs(PERSON) isd(PERSON) , told kxan(GPE) the , “ parents of the students who were involved were immediately notified of the incident as well as the hays county sheriff ’s office and child protective services . ” dripping springs(PERSON) isd(PERSON) did not give details on the alleged incident or the title ix investigation . 

the(DATE) day(DATE) the investigation closed , the mom said the district told the parents and their child to sign a new order for their child to stay away from the other child . this upset the mom , who feels that signing the order would make her child feel like they did something wrong . 

edwards(PERSON) tells kxan(GPE) that “ state and federal laws protecting student privacy do not allow the district to provide specific details about this incident . ” 

the outcome 

after the investigation , the mom said she asked their child ’s teacher about the stay - away order and to report any changes in their child ’s well - being or behavior . 

“ the teacher said they did n’t even know about the order , ” the mom said . “ the isd(ORG) said it would n’t release a notice to parents about the assault because it would be a ferpa ( family educational rights and privacy act ) violation . ” 

since then , the parents spoke with other parents , rallying others to support reforming district policies . 

“ it breaks my heart , ” the mom said . “ the policies in place are n’t good enough . we used to not have to lock doors at schools , but because of school shootings , we have to now . something needs to change . we have to do things different . ” 

the mom , along with 10(CARDINAL) other parents , met with dripping springs isd(ORG) and school leaders on friday(DATE) ,(DATE) march(DATE) 1(DATE) . they went armed with talking points : what is staff required to do if a student under the(DATE) age(DATE) of(DATE) 10(DATE) tells about a sexual assault ? how will the isd(ORG) support victims ? how does the school teach students about boundaries and abuse ? 

“ children deserve a trauma - informed and victim - centered response by the school system : asking a victim to sign stay - away documents appears to demonstrate a lack of understanding of proper child development , ” reads the talking points shared by the mom . “ being asked to sign a document may be interpreted by the child that they have done something wrong , which is a common feeling expressed by children who have experienced abuse and often keeps them from disclosing . ” 

she said her focus is on preventing other parents and students from experiencing what happened to her family . 

“ it ’s an uncomfortable conversation that a school district does n’t want to have . but we need to have it , ” the mom said . “ i just hope the district does n’t retaliate against us because i ’m advocating for my child . ” 

the meeting 

according to the mom , the friday(DATE) meeting felt like a “ step in the right direction , ” with leaders apologizing for perceived missteps in the process . 

“ it ’s going to be a journey , but i think they ’re willing to take appropriate steps , ” she said . 

the mom said the group received verbal commitments from district leaders at the meeting , including : 

new security cameras , already funded through state grants for school security 

better zoning and patrolling by adults supervising students during recess 

the expansion of opt - in abuse prevention training to k-5 students 

according to her , meeting attendees also discussed having further discussions with the district about safety policies . 

dripping springs(PERSON) isd(PERSON) provided a statement to kxan(GPE) friday(DATE) afternoon(TIME) : 

the safety of the students of dripping springs isd(ORG) is the district ’s first(ORDINAL) and most important priority . our staff takes all reports of harm to students seriously and investigates incidents fully to determine the actions necessary to ensure the safety of all students . the incident was immediately reported to law enforcement and child protective services . the district ’s title ix coordinator was notified and the appropriate procedures were followed in accordance with federal law . 

jennifer(PERSON) edwards(PERSON) , dripping springs(ORG) isd(ORG) executive director of communications 

kxan(GPE) also asked dripping springs isd(ORG) officials if they intended to change any policies as a result of the investigation . 

“ the district regularly reviews its policies and practices in order to best serve the students and families of dsisd(GPE) ; however , the district did not identify any concerns in the handling of this matter by campus administration , ” said edwards(PERSON) in response to kxan(GPE) ’s question . “ the campus took appropriate action to inform and support the involved families and ensure the safety of all students . ” 

when told about the district ’s response , the mom was surprised and disappointed , calling it an “ unfortunate inconsistency . ” 

“ this will make parents more upset , ” the mom said . “ i guess we ’re back to square one if they do n’t think things need to change . ” 

kxan(GPE) followed up with edwards(PERSON) about those answers . she reiterated that the district did not identify any missteps or mistakes in its process , calling the mom ’s account of the friday(DATE) meeting “ inaccurate . ” 

“ in our investigation of how the administration handled the incident , the district did not identify any missteps or mistakes . as stated , the district is always willing to review our policies and procedures in an effort to improve operations and student safety , ” edwards(PERSON) said .

new western training center seeks to grow prescribed fire capacity 

prescribed fire is an effective tool to make catastrophic wildfires less likely , and now federal land management agencies are expanding training for those important burns . 

in a recent forest service strategy document , officials are blunt about the situation they face . 

“ the prescribed fire implementation environment continues to grow in complexity , whereas the ability of practitioners to practice and hone their expertise has lagged , particularly in the western united states , ” it reads . 

but a new program - the western prescribed fire training center - seeks to address that training gap . the first(ORDINAL) class is already burning and receiving training in oklahoma(GPE) . a national interagency prescribed fire training center already exists in tallahassee(GPE) , florida(GPE) , where over(QUANTITY) 1(QUANTITY) million(QUANTITY) acres(QUANTITY) were burned in 2021(DATE) . the western center is conceived of as an expansion of that program . 

classrooms for training will be set up near prescribed fires in existing offices , or other locations , according to the strategy . federal officials hope the effort will “ increase the pace of prescribed fire training - to - qualification in the(GPE) western(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) , provide trainees real - time experience in different fuel types and terrain , and ultimately increase national prescribed fire resource capacity . ” 

additional sessions will be held this(DATE) year(DATE) in boise , flagstaff(ORG) and elsewhere , according to alex(PERSON) robertson(PERSON) , the acting director of fire and aviation at the forest service ’s d.c(GPE) .(GPE) office . 

he said that increasing the amount of prescribed burning is all about taking advantage of the windows that mother nature provides . 

“ and if we 're not nimble enough , if we 're not prepared enough , if we 're not skilled enough to take advantage of every window , we 're not going to get more done , ” he said . 

robertson(PERSON) said that doing the training at sites around the west will give trainees experience with different fuel types and “ different politics around prescribed fire in different communities . ”

email - reprimanding - napping - students - at - malachowsky - hall - brings - backlash : 

on feb(DATE) .(DATE) 7(DATE) , around(CARDINAL) 50(CARDINAL) students received an email whose first(ORDINAL) line read , “ we appreciate how hard our faculty and students work , but it ’s malachowsky(PERSON) hall(PERSON) , not malachowsky hotel . ” 

it referenced students sleeping in the graduate student village in malachowsky(FAC) hall(FAC) and included two(CARDINAL) photos of the culprits . 

the email was sent by david(PERSON) arnold(PERSON) , professor and associate chair for faculty affairs at the(ORG) department(ORG) of(ORG) electrical(ORG) and computer engineering . he wrote that multiple students had been sleeping in meeting booths on the fourth(ORDINAL) floor of the building . 

if students continue to use the space for sleeping , they may have their access to the student villages — located on the fourth(ORDINAL) floor — revoked , according to the message . 

the message finished by telling students to reach out to their advisers and arnold(PERSON) himself if they feel stressed or overworked . 

“ we want to ensure a healthy working environment for all our students and employees , ” arnold(PERSON) wrote . 

what surprised students the most was the two(CARDINAL) photos of students sleeping attached to the email as evidence of the situation . 

a screenshot of the email circulated on the unofficial uf reddit page . throughout the(DATE) week(DATE) , students expressed concern and frustration toward the email ’s tone . the original post that contained the screenshot of the email has since been taken down . 

agustin(NORP) giraldo(PERSON) , a 24(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) -(DATE) old(DATE) uf computer science major , spends anywhere from three(TIME) to(TIME) 20(TIME) hours(TIME) a week at malachowsky(ORG) hall(ORG) for classes , studying and club meetings . he enjoys how productive malachowsky makes him feel , but the unclear restrictions and the lack of vending machines can get frustrating , he said . 

he found out about the email through reddit . he was mainly caught off guard when he saw the photos attached to the email . 

“ it was unreasonable to take someone ’s picture without their consent , especially if they ’re sleeping , ” giraldo(PERSON) said . “ if you want to reiterate why that was bad , those photos were unnecessary . ” after reading the email , his perception of the building changed . 

“ is it an academic center , or is it a business center ? ” he said . “ what exactly is the purpose of malachowsky if it was n’t for students or graduate students ? ” 

he ’s realized that many rooms stay locked and require special key access . he recently found out that he could n’t stay studying later(TIME) in(TIME) the(TIME) night(TIME) because a security guard approached him around(TIME) 8(TIME) p.m.(TIME) and informed him students could n’t be in the building past a(TIME) certain(TIME) hour(TIME) . 

ivan(PERSON) ruchkin(PERSON) , an engineering professor , was surprised when he first(ORDINAL) received the email . some of his students asked him about it , he said . 

“ they were trying to get a sense of both the reasoning and the rationale behind it , ” he said . 

he understands situations need to be reported , he said , especially when students can spend any time between(DATE) three(DATE) and(DATE) 50(DATE) hours(DATE) a week in malachowsky(GPE) hall(GPE) . 

the scope of the email went beyond current graduate students , toward whom the email was geared . 

joseph(PERSON) melville(PERSON) , 32(DATE) , was sent the email despite having graduated last(DATE) year(DATE) . when he was a student , malachowsky(PERSON) hall(PERSON) had n’t opened yet . he remembered being skeptical about the open floor plan because the clear doors and rooms could get in the way of graduate assistants ’ privacy . 

“ it was funny in a slightly sad way , ” melville(GPE) said about the email . 

melville(GPE) was part of the graduate student wellness committee for the electrical and computer engineering department . 

“ it ’s hard to say exactly what needs to be done , ” melville(GPE) said . “ professors have their needs that need to be met also . ” 

while he is no longer a student , he said there is still a lot to be done to make sure rules and expectations are as transparent as possible . 

while resources exist to help graduate assistants , there ’s little awareness that they exist , melville(GPE) said . to him , the main problem is that “ students felt like they were n’t listened to enough . ” 

shayan(ORG) hadjiabadi(ORG) , a 27(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) -(DATE) old(DATE) uf genetics and plant breeding graduate student , spends up(TIME) to(TIME) six(TIME) hours(TIME) a week in malachowsky(ORG) hall(ORG) and enjoys the graduate student room . he heard about the email after a cohort member forwarded it to him . 

the email was “ just very confusing , ” hadjiabadi(PERSON) said . 

“ i ’ve seen people sleeping just like i see people sleeping in marston(ORG) and lib west , ” he said . “ i ’ve never thought twice about it . ” 

it was n’t the first(ORDINAL) time he ’d heard about instances of students clashing with building administrators . 

“ there were solitary incidents where people were spoken to personally face - to - face , not in a mass email setting , ” he said . “ it ’s pretty unusual to see an email that ’s so pointed . ” 

mark(PERSON) tehranipoir(PERSON) , the chair of the(ORG) department(ORG) of(ORG) electrical(ORG) and computer engineering , wrote in an email that custodial staff originally brought the issue to the attention of the college ’s leadership . he wrote that the email ’s intent was never to be insensitive . 

“ on friday(DATE) afternoon(TIME) , department leadership met with students to reset the conversation , listen to their concerns and work together on finding solutions , ” he wrote . 

according to him , the meeting was productive . 

he wrote that graduate - level engineering is very demanding , but he ’s committed to making malachowsky a supportive learning environment . ”

the russian(NORP) head of the city reported an " incident " had occurred -- language previously used to describe ukrainian(NORP) attacks -- but said there were no casualties . 

videos on russian(NORP) social media showed what appeared to be a drone falling from the sky into the building , triggering an explosion , and locals said the blown out windows and small fires were caused by a drone hit . 

ukrainian(NORP) media reported russian(NORP) air defences had shot down a drone that was targeting an oil depot less(QUANTITY) than(QUANTITY) a(QUANTITY) kilometre(QUANTITY) away from the building struck in saint petersburg(GPE) . 

kyiv has hit several russian(NORP) oil refineries in recent(DATE) months(DATE) in what it has called fair retribution for moscow(GPE) 's attacks on ukraine(GPE) 's power grid .

" when kennedy(PERSON) was shot , nobody blamed the gun , " he wrote . at the time of writing , the post had been viewed 761,100(CARDINAL) times . 

people took to rich 's post to criticize him for his take , with many disagreeing with what he said . 

newsweek(ORG) contacted a spokesperson for rich via email friday(DATE) for comment . 

" uh , you should probably just shut up now , " one(CARDINAL) person wrote .

a fourth(ORDINAL) added : " when jfk(PERSON) was shot , everyone and everything was blamed . "

" the good gentleman has a point , " a different x user said . 

" democrats(NORP) had not been taken over by crazy people yet , " wrote another . 

" good point , but nowadays no one takes the blame , it is always someone else , and this shows in the current leadership as well , " someone else commented .

trump - waves - at - migrants - texas(GPE) - border - visit - they - like - me-2024 - 3(CARDINAL) : 

- donald trump waved at migrants at the southern border and exclaimed that they like him . 

- trump has proposed launching a mass deportation campaign if reelected in 2024(DATE) . 

- on a rival visit , biden(PERSON) urged trump to support a bipartisan border security package . 

former president donald(PERSON) trump(PERSON) waved and pumped his fist at migrants at the southern border with mexico(GPE) — the very same ones he is trying to keep out of the country . 

" they like trump , can you believe it ? " an amused trump said while visiting the border near the rio grande in texas(GPE) on thursday(DATE) . 

" they like me , governor , " trump added to texas(GPE) gov . greg(PERSON) abbot(PERSON) , who was taking him on a border tour . 

trump(PERSON) has suggested that he would launch the largest deportation campaign in history if he 's reelected in 2024(DATE) , among other stringent measures to keep migrants out . 

not long after he waved at the migrants , trump(PERSON) gave a speech at eagle pass in which he said biden(PERSON) had the " blood of countless innocent victims " on his hands " because of his immigration policies . 

he listed specific cases in which undocumented immigrants were reported to have attacked people , including the killing of 22(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) -(DATE) old(DATE) laken(PERSON) riley(PERSON) , whose death has grabbed national attention . 

" the monster charged in the death is an illegal alien migrant who was led into our country and released into our country by crooked joe(PERSON) biden(PERSON) , " trump(PERSON) said . 

despite such individual cases , studies have found that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than us - born individuals . 

president biden(PERSON) tells trump(PERSON) — ' join me ' 

president joe(PERSON) biden(PERSON) simultaneously visited another border town across the state on thursday(DATE) as both tried to score political points on the flash point issue of immigration as the november(DATE) election nears . 

polls show that immigration is one of biden(ORG) 's major vulnerabilities , and trump has continued to highlight his contrastingly draconian approach . 

on his rival texas(GPE) visit , biden(PERSON) urged trump to help him pass his proposed border security package , which republicans(NORP) tanked under trump(PERSON) 's orders . 

the package would see billions(MONEY) of(MONEY) dollars(MONEY) put toward staff and resources on the southern border , where officials have been overwhelmed by a surge in migrant crossings . 

" here 's what i would say to mr trump(PERSON) , " biden(PERSON) said . " instead of playing politics with the issue , instead of telling members of congress(ORG) to block this legislation , join me . " 

" you know , and i know it 's the toughest , most efficient , most effective border security bill this country 's ever seen . so instead of playing politics with the issue , why do n't we just get together and get it done ? " biden(PERSON) said .

202403020052.html(CARDINAL) : 

as external actors seem to lessen pressure on west(GPE) africa(GPE) 's(GPE) juntas(ORG) , guineans(NORP) register their discontent with military governance . 

from one(CARDINAL) perspective , the(DATE) past(DATE) week(DATE) has been a success for military rulers in west(GPE) africa(GPE) . the economic community of west(NORP) african(NORP) states ( ecowas ) , announced the easing of sanctions on niger(GPE) , mali(PERSON) , and guinea , backing down from earlier efforts to draw a hard line against unconstitutional transfers of power in the region . while the regional bloc 's decision may not be sufficient to bring the so - called alliance of sahel states ( consisting of mali(NORP) , burkina(GPE) faso , and niger(GPE) ) back into the fold , it can still be seen as a validation of the juntas(ORG) ' determination to resist external pressure . 

internal pressure is another story entirely . instead of celebrating the ecowas decision , guineans(NORP) were expressing their deep dissatisfaction with the government ecowas was attempting to placate . a national strike began on monday(DATE) as trade unions demanded not just better wages , but an end to internet restrictions and the release of the secretary general of the(ORG) union(ORG) of(ORG) press(ORG) professionals(ORG) . in some areas , demonstrators clashed with security forces , a far cry from the exuberant masses that came out to cheer mamady doumbouya(PERSON) and his uniformed comrades when they overthrew the government in 2021(DATE) . 

it 's clear that the junta is under pressure . on february(DATE) 20(DATE) , doumbouya(PERSON) abruptly dissolved the transitional government and sealed the country 's borders . a(DATE) week(DATE) later(DATE) came a decree that former opposition leader mamadou(PERSON) bah(PERSON) had been appointed prime minister . the general strike has now been suspended , but popular dissatisfaction with the cost of living and demands for greater civil and political rights will persist . 

the change that the military leaders promoted as they ousted former president alpha conde -- following his manipulation of the constitutional and electoral landscape to devise a third(ORDINAL) term -- has been harder to deliver than it was to promise . for all of doumbouya(PERSON) 's pan(NORP) -(NORP) african(NORP) posturing in international fora , he has been unable to perform any heroics for the population he supposedly serves . since june(DATE) , guineans(NORP) have taken to the streets to protest against the military regime , sometimes at the cost of their lives . it 's worth watching what happens now that the bloom is off the rose . the resistance of guineans(NORP) is just as significant a signal of what african(NORP) populations want as the initial reactions to military seizures of power .

the - long - forgotten - story - of-73 - children - kidnapped - by - pirates - that - created - international - headlines : 

when 73(CARDINAL) british(NORP) , american(NORP) , and scandinavian(NORP) children boarded a steamboat in shanghai(GPE) on january(DATE) 29(DATE) ,(DATE) 1935(DATE) , little they did they know that they would soon be fated to meet a notorious band of pirates who had harassed the chinese(NORP) coast for decades(DATE) . 

one(CARDINAL) of the last significant pirate strongholds , bias bay lies in the southern coast of guangdong(GPE) province(GPE) in southern(LOC) china(LOC) , not too far from hong(GPE) kong(GPE) . the bias bay pirates were led by the female pirate lai(PERSON) choi(PERSON) san(PERSON) , who is believed to have had thousands(CARDINAL) of chinese(NORP) junk ships at her command . one(CARDINAL) such ship would cause global attention . 

the pirates attack 

when the steamboat known as the(ORG) ss(ORG) tungchow(ORG) embarked from shanghai(GPE) , it was expected to dock in yantai within a(DATE) day(DATE) , where most of its passengers — 73(CARDINAL) kids of various ages — would be studying at the chinese(NORP) inland ’s missions school , also known as the(ORG) chefoo(ORG) school(ORG) , whose purpose was to provide an education for the children of foreign missionaries and businessmen . most of those foreign families lived in shanghai(GPE) , so this was a return trip for the children after visiting their respective families . 

at 6(TIME) pm(TIME) on that tuesday(DATE) night of january 29 , shortly after the passengers had finished their dinner , a lone , unthreatening junk ship appeared nearby , but a commotion on deck earned the attention of the guards ; a shot rang out as several passengers of the tungchow suddenly drew firearms and started barking orders . these gun - wielding assailants were pirates , and had boarded the ship in shanghai(GPE) alongside other passengers . as they made their move , the junk ship came closer and rode alongside the steamboat uncontested , its hidden cannons not required . 

overall , only(CARDINAL) 13(CARDINAL) pirates total boarded the tungchow(ORG) , but that ’s all the manpower they needed . 

mr . k.(PERSON) macdonald(PERSON) , the second(ORDINAL) engineer for the steamboat , immediately rushed out of his cabin upon hearing the alarm . he was met by the pirates , and gunfire ensued . shot in the chest , macdonald(PERSON) nevertheless somehow lived to tell the tale of the attack . 

two(CARDINAL) of the four(CARDINAL) russian(NORP) guards of the ship were also shot , including one who had fought against four(CARDINAL) of the pirates . multiple accounts claim he was still alive some(TIME) 20(TIME) minutes(TIME) later(TIME) , but was then brutally killed . the other guard who was shot survived . the other two(CARDINAL) guards were overwhelmed and taken captive by the pirates along with the other passengers , including the children . the captives were then held in the ship ’s saloon . 

fool ’s gold 

the pirates had acted so swiftly that they had already taken the radio operator hostage , preventing any word from getting out . they had quickly taken the captain hostage also , and stormed the engine room . 

one(CARDINAL) uncredited account detailed what happened next , which reveals what the pirates were after : 

“ ordered to unlock the door of the strong - room , the purser did so without the slightest reluctance , but so eager were the pirates to see the gold that they delayed him by trying to speed him up with nudgings of their guns . finally the heavy , burglar - proof steel door swung open , with a dismal groan which was echoed by even more dismal ones from the pirates when they saw that it contained nothing , not even a speck of dust . ” 

the pirates , furiously disappointed upon realizing they had been lied to , needed to decide what to do next . they could leave with only the money they took from each passenger , as well as some random loot from the ship — or they could take hostages . they decided to steer the ship south towards bias bay , which was a(DATE) couple(DATE) days(DATE) away . with 73(CARDINAL) children held captive , surely a significant ransom would be paid . thus , they departed the yellow sea and headed for the south(LOC) china(LOC) sea(LOC) . 

once in bias bay , they would be safe from the authorities and in their own den of pirates , including the ruthless lai choi san herself . 

the tungchow(ORG) disappears 

when the ship was nearly(DATE) a(DATE) day(DATE) late(DATE) to arrive at its destination of yantai , the port informed authorities . 

all ships were then on the lookout for the tungchow , but two(DATE) days(DATE) passed without a single sighting , despite the chinese(NORP) and british(NORP) governments reacting by sending out ships in a desperate search for the steamboat , while also informing others in the waters . the british(NORP) and the chinese(NORP) assumed there was a chance that if the tungchow(ORG) had been taken over by pirates , then it would be headed to bias bay , but even along that sea route , there was no sign of the tungchow . it was as if the ship had completely disappeared . did it sink ? did it vanish ? 

as it turns out , the pirates did make the tungchow disappear . no , it was n’t magic . 

once the pirates decided to stay on the ship and head to bias bay , they employed a clever plan ; they painted the ship ’s funnel red , and also painted over the name “ ss(PERSON) tungchow(PERSON) . ” they even repainted a new name , “ toa(ORG) maru(ORG) , ” onto the ship . 

hence , the tungchow sailed through busy waters unspotted . it even passed numerous ships that were looking for it , including within close range of a searching british(NORP) vessel ; the pirates succeeded in completely disguising the ship . it no longer fit the description of the tungchow , and did not bear its name . the(ORG) toa(ORG) maru(ORG) was not just a random name , either ; it was the name of a known ship , one that had been recently restored near hong(GPE) kong(GPE) . 

the pirate chief and the children 

as the 13(CARDINAL) pirates , led by an unnamed chief , controlled the ship and its passengers , they at least made sure everyone was fed . when one(CARDINAL) adult passenger , described as “ a pompous man with a large mustache , ” complained that he did n’t have enough to eat , the pirates would poke him with their guns . the man also behaved miserably towards the children , saying he believed they should all keep quiet . the pirate chief noticed that the children were rather delighted at seeing the pirates trouble the man , so he made sure to nudge him whenever he spoke as a way to keep him quiet , instead . 

mr . pj(PERSON) duncan(PERSON) , the master in charge of the 73(CARDINAL) children — and whose detailed account was cited in newspapers around the world in the(DATE) following(DATE) months(DATE) — pointed out the unique relationship that formed between the chief and the children . 

the pirate chief took a liking to the youngsters , because instead of being afraid of him , they were in awe . they had never seen a real life pirate before , and their adventurous spirits were too star - struck to understand the gravity of the situation . despite the pirates having shot three(CARDINAL) men , killing one , the children were admiring observers of a real - life pirate movie unfolding before their eyes . 

the pirate chief would often grab oranges stored on the ship , and toss them to the children only . he even found candy stored on the ship , and give the children treats . he entertained them with his pirate stories , and his rather unusual upbringing of being raised by a pirate to be a pirate , which many in bias bay were . it ’s likely that this pirate chief — only described as “ fairly young ” by duncan(PERSON) — never met such a delighted audience for his tales outside of bias bay . 

the(ORG) british(ORG) navy(ORG) near bias bay 

a(DATE) month(DATE) earlier(DATE) , a british(NORP) carrier named hermes(ORG) had stationed itself in hong(GPE) kong(GPE) . when authorities were notified of the missing steamboat with many british(NORP) children aboard , the(ORG) british(ORG) navy(ORG) quickly reacted , and hermes(PERSON) was immediately dispatched . 

at noon(TIME) on friday(DATE) ,(DATE) february(DATE) 1(DATE) , aircraft from the(ORG) hermes(ORG) spotted a steamboat just outside bias bay , seemingly headed towards a location known to be a pirate den . the pilots realized it could be the tungchow in disguise , and they were right . 

the pirates , upon realizing they ’d been spotted , quickly hopped onto a lifeboat with two(CARDINAL) adult hostages in order to prevent the aircraft from firing . they had made off with some loot from the steamboat , also . they were n’t alerted of any aircraft search ahead of time because they had , regrettably , destroyed the tungchow(ORG) ’s communications . the pirates then headed for a small island nearby . upon reaching shore , they left the hostages there . once the surveilling aircraft departed , the pirates sailed away to a larger boat of their own , and raced safely to bias bay before more help arrived to take the tungchow home . 

the only life lost in the affair was that of the russian(NORP) guard , whose name was only published as “ tchornoff . ” all other passengers survived . none of the 73(CARDINAL) children were harmed . 

the pirate chief bids farewell to the children 

when the pirate chief initially departed the tungchow(ORG) on the lifeboat , he turned around to face the children , all 73(CARDINAL) of whom were looking at him . he flamboyantly bowed towards them , as a theater actor might after giving a performance worthy of a standing ovation . as the lifeboat reached closer to the shore , he turned around again to offer another bow , but the children had all dashed to the other side of the tungchow in an attempt to grab the pirate chief ’s sweater , which he had unintentionally left on board . in doing so , they accidentally ripped it to pieces , and thus many kept a small piece to themselves . 

spared were the children from meeting the leader of all pirates , lai(PERSON) choi(PERSON) san(PERSON) . 

was the pirate chief really going to keep the children hostages in bias bay ? one(CARDINAL) account claims that the pirates had already boarded a lifeboat and had began heading to the small island before any aircraft were spotted . if true , then why leave the children there ? did the children ’s admiration for the pirate make him have a change of heart ? one can only assume or , perhaps more accurately , believe that the tale deserves such an ending . 

during the ordeal , and most especially afterwards , newspapers around the globe reported the occurrence . this article was pieced together by reading all known accounts of the incident , including detailed reports in the san(GPE) francisco(GPE) examiner , the(ORG) pittsburgh(ORG) sun(ORG) -(ORG) telegraph(ORG) , and the(ORG) liverpool(ORG) daily(ORG) post(ORG) , amongst many other newspapers .

michigan(GPE) republicans(NORP) at their convention in grand rapids began allocating 39(CARDINAL) of the state ’s 55(CARDINAL) gop(ORG) presidential delegates . trump(PERSON) won all 39(CARDINAL) delegates allocated . 

but a significant portion of the party ’s grassroots force was skipping the gathering because of the lingering effects of a monthslong(DATE) dispute over the party 's leadership . 

trump(PERSON) handily won michigan(GPE) ’s primary this(DATE) past(DATE) tuesday(DATE) with 68(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) of the vote compared with haley(PERSON) ’s 27(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) . 

michigan(GPE) republicans(NORP) were forced to split their delegate allocation into two(CARDINAL) parts after democrats(NORP) , who control the state government , moved michigan(GPE) into the early primary states , violating the(ORG) national(ORG) republican(ORG) party(ORG) ’s(ORG) rules .

voters lined up outside a church in columbia(GPE) , home to the(ORG) university(ORG) of(ORG) missouri(ORG) , before the doors opened for the caucuses . once they got inside , they heard appeals from supporters of the candidates . 

“ every(DATE) 100(DATE) days(DATE) , we ’re spending $(MONEY) 1(MONEY) trillion(MONEY) , with money going all over the world . illegals are running across the border , ” tom(PERSON) mendenall(PERSON) , an elector for trump in 2016(DATE) and 2020(DATE) , said to the crowd . he later added : “ you know where donald(PERSON) trump(PERSON) stands on a lot of these issues . ”

“ i do n’t need to hear about mr . trump(PERSON) ’s dalliances with people of unsavory character , nor do my children , ” christensen(PERSON) said to the room . “ and if we put that man in the office , that ’s what we ’re going to hear about all the time . and i ’m through with it . ” 

supporters quickly moved to one(CARDINAL) side of the room or the other , depending on whether they favored trump or haley(PERSON) . there was little discussion between caucusgoers after they chose a side . 

this(DATE) year(DATE) was the first(ORDINAL) test of the new system , which is almost entirely run by volunteers on the republican(NORP) side .

trump(PERSON) prevailed twice under missouri(GPE) 's old presidential primary system .

the republican(NORP) - led legislature considered holding a special session to reinstate the presidential primaries but failed to agree on a proposal in time , leaving both parties with presidential caucuses as the only option . 

" i think there ’s been a lot of confusion because most people do n’t realize that our legislature actually voted in a flawed bill , ” said jessie(PERSON) bryant(PERSON) , who volunteered at a caucus site near downtown boise . “ so the caucus is really just the best - case scenario to actually get an opportunity to vote for a presidential candidate and nominate them for the gop(ORG) . ” 

one(CARDINAL) of those voters was john(PERSON) graves(PERSON) , a fire protection engineer from boise . he said the caucus(ORG) was fast and easy , not much different from idaho(GPE) ’s usual republican(NORP) primary . he anticipated the win would go to trump . 

“ it ’s a very conservative state , so i would think that trump will probably carry it quite easily , ” graves said . “ and i like that . ”

saturday(DATE) ,(DATE) march(DATE) 2nd(DATE) 2024(DATE) , 11:51(PERSON) am 

firefighters battling the largest wildfire in texas(GPE) history face increasingly difficult weather conditions on saturday(DATE) . 

the(ORG) smokehouse(ORG) creek(ORG) fire that began monday(DATE) has killed at(CARDINAL) least(CARDINAL) two(CARDINAL) people , left a charred landscape of scorched prairie , dead cattle and destroyed as(CARDINAL) many(CARDINAL) as(CARDINAL) 500(CARDINAL) structures , including burned - out homes , in the texas(GPE) panhandle . 

watch live : news 9(TIME) 6(TIME) p.m.(TIME) newscast 3/2/2024(CARDINAL) 

the national weather service in amarillo(GPE) has issued a red flag warning for the entire panhandle from late(TIME) saturday(TIME) morning(TIME) through(TIME) midnight(TIME) sunday(DATE) after rain and snow on thursday(DATE) allowed firefighters to contain a portion of the fire . 

" a combination of strong winds , low relative humidity and warm temperatures will create favorable weather for rapid fire growth and spread , " according to the weather service 's forecast . 

" critical fire weather conditions are expected to return ... as winds out of the southwest gust to 40(QUANTITY) to(QUANTITY) 45(QUANTITY) mph(QUANTITY) and humidity drops below(PERCENT) 10(PERCENT) percent(PERCENT) , " the forecast said , with a high temperature of 75(QUANTITY) degrees(QUANTITY) f(QUANTITY) ( 24(QUANTITY) degrees(QUANTITY) c ) . 

the fire , which has merged with another fire and crossed the state line into western(LOC) oklahoma(LOC) , has burned more(QUANTITY) than(QUANTITY) 1,700(QUANTITY) square(QUANTITY) miles(QUANTITY) ( 4,400(QUANTITY) square(QUANTITY) kilometers(QUANTITY) ) and was 15(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) contained , the(ORG) texas(ORG) a&m(ORG) forest(ORG) service(ORG) said friday(DATE) . 

the cause of the fire remains under investigation , although strong winds , dry grass and unseasonably warm weather fed the flames . 

" everybody needs to understand that we face enormous potential fire dangers as we head into this(DATE) weekend(DATE) , " republican(NORP) gov . greg(PERSON) abbott(PERSON) said friday(DATE) after touring the area . " no one can let down their guard . everyone must remain very vigilant . " 

two(CARDINAL) women were confirmed killed by the fires this(DATE) week(DATE) . but with flames still menacing a wide area , authorities have n't yet thoroughly searched for victims or tallied homes and other structures damaged or destroyed . 

two(CARDINAL) firefighters were injured battling the flames in oklahoma(GPE) . one(CARDINAL) suffered a heat - related injury and the other was injured when the brush pumper he was riding in struck a tanker truck as the two(CARDINAL) were heading to fight the fire near gage . 

both firefighters are expected to recover . 

texas(ORG) agriculture(ORG) commissioner sid(PERSON) miller(PERSON) said individual ranchers could suffer devastating losses due to the fires , but predicted the overall impact on the texas(GPE) cattle industry and consumer beef prices would be minimal . the fires are leaving " dead animals everywhere , " texas rep . ronny(PERSON) jackson(PERSON) said in a video update on wednesday(DATE) .

fishermen - possible - spy - balloon - fbi - alaska : 

commercial fishermen off the coast of alaska(GPE) have found what officials are concerned could be another spy balloon and are bringing it to shore with them , three(CARDINAL) sources familiar with the matter told cnn(ORG) . 

fbi(ORG) agents will meet the fishing vessel when it comes into port , which is expected to be sometime over the(DATE) weekend(DATE) . the bureau will then transport the unknown object to the fbi(ORG) lab in quantico(GPE) , virginia(GPE) , to be analyzed , as has been done with previous surveillance balloons . 

the fishmen shared photographs of the object with law enforcement upon encountering it , the sources said . all three(CARDINAL) sources emphasized that it was n’t clear exactly what the object was and that it may not be a balloon at all — but that the fbi(ORG) determined that it was similar enough in appearance to a foreign - government owned surveillance balloon that it warranted further investigation . 

the fbi(ORG) said in a statement friday(DATE) night(TIME) it is “ aware of debris found off the coast of alaska(GPE) by a commercial fishing vessel . we will work with our partners to assist with the logistics of the debris recovery . ” 

cnn(ORG) was unable to identify the fishing vessel . 

the existence of high - altitude surveillance balloons burst into us consciousness last(DATE) year(DATE) , when a chinese(NORP) spy balloon appeared to blow off course and transited across the continental us . that balloon entered us territory through alaskan(NORP) airspace . 

the us(GPE) assessed that the spy balloon was part of an extensive surveillance program run by the chinese(NORP) military , as cnn(ORG) reported at the time . the balloon fleet , according to us officials , had conducted at(CARDINAL) least(CARDINAL) two(CARDINAL) dozen(CARDINAL) missions over at(CARDINAL) least(CARDINAL) five(CARDINAL) continents in recent(DATE) years(DATE) . 

china(GPE) appeared to suspend the program following the episode , and it ’s not clear whether it has been restarted . taiwan(GPE) in january(DATE) accused beijing(GPE) of flying multiple balloons through its airspace . 

the biden administration ultimately shot down the balloon that flew over the us(GPE) last(DATE) february(DATE) . following the incident , the us(GPE) widened the aperture of its radar systems so that it could better detect objects traveling above a certain altitude and at certain speeds . the aim was to fix a “ domain awareness gap ” that had allowed three(CARDINAL) other suspected chinese(NORP) spy balloons to transit the(ORG) continental(ORG) united(ORG) states(ORG) undetected under the trump administration , gen(ORG) . glen(PERSON) vanherck(PERSON) , commander of us northern command and north(ORG) american(ORG) aerospace(ORG) defense(ORG) command(ORG) , said at the time . 

the more sensitive radar systems have allowed the us(GPE) military to spot more unidentified objects in us airspace . there were three(CARDINAL) additional shootdowns of unidentified high - altitude objects in the(DATE) weeks(DATE) following the chinese(NORP) balloon incident . just(DATE) last(DATE) week(DATE) , the north(NORP) american(NORP) aerospace defense command sent fighter jets to intercept and examine a small balloon over the southwest , drifting east . norad(PERSON) later said in a statement that the balloon was “ likely a hobby balloon ” that posed no threat . 

the pentagon(ORG) had said that the chinese(NORP) surveillance balloon did not collect intelligence while flying over the country , but us intelligence agencies did find that it used an american(NORP) internet service provider to send short , periodic transmissions of data related to navigation and location back to china(GPE) , according to a us official . 

the network connection was not used to transmit intelligence back to china(GPE) , according to the official . the balloon stored that information for later , including imagery and other data , which the us(GPE) has since been able to study . 

this story has bene updated with additional reporting .

labour - criticises - lee - andersons - appearance - at - tory - fundraiser - with - liz - truss : 

labour said it “ beggars belief ” that lee(PERSON) anderson(PERSON) reportedly attended a conservative fundraiser with former prime minister liz(PERSON) truss(PERSON) , despite currently being suspended as a tory mp . 

a report in the daily(DATE) express suggested mr anderson(PERSON) was at a dinner to raise money for bassetlaw mp brendan(PERSON) clarke(PERSON) -(PERSON) smith(PERSON) on friday(DATE) . 

the former tory(NORP) deputy chairman is said to have been given a standing ovation by those in attendance , with ms truss , according to an anonymous onlooker cited by the newspaper , saying , “ who is this de - whipped tory ? ” as she greeted him . 

the express published a photo which it says shows mr anderson(PERSON) , ms truss and mr clarke(PERSON) -(PERSON) smith(PERSON) posing together at the fundraiser . 

labour has urged prime minister rishi(PERSON) sunak(PERSON) to ban mr anderson(PERSON) from raising funds for the tories while he is without the party whip . 

mr anderson(PERSON) , an outspoken mp in the ‘ red wall ’ — labour ’s traditional heartlands across the midlands and north of england where the tories made gains during the 2019(DATE) election — has refused to apologise for the remarks despite mr sunak labelling them “ wrong ” . 

the former labour councillor has also refused to rule out potentially standing for reform uk , the former brexit party , at the next election . 

jonathan(PERSON) ashworth(PERSON) , labour ’s shadow paymaster general , said : “ it beggars belief that , far from being suspended from the tories as rishi(PERSON) sunak(PERSON) told us , here he is : lee(PERSON) anderson(PERSON) , parading around the north notts rubber chicken circuit with none other than liz(PERSON) truss . 

“ given rishi(PERSON) sunak(PERSON) deems mr anderson(PERSON) as unfit to be a tory mp , he now needs to bar him from fundraising for the(ORG) tory(ORG) party(ORG) . 

“ unless he takes action , rishi(PERSON) sunak(PERSON) will again be exposed as weaker than ever , and out of control of his chaotic , divided party . ” 

ms truss had been due to speak about her brief tenure in no 10 in 2022(DATE) , including the passing of queen elizabeth(PERSON) ii(PERSON) , before her mini - budget helped send the economy tumbling , leading to her being ousted after just(DATE) 44(DATE) days(DATE) in office . 

labour has previously called for ms truss to have the tory whip removed after her attendance at the right - wing conservative political action conference in the us(GPE) . 

while at the event last(DATE) month(DATE) , she claimed her efforts to cut taxes were “ sabotaged ” by the “ deep state ” . 

the former tory(NORP) leader later took part in an interview with steve(PERSON) bannon(PERSON) , who served as a senior white(ORG) house(ORG) aide to former republican(NORP) us(GPE) president donald(PERSON) trump(PERSON) , and remained silent as he hailed british(NORP) far - right figure tommy(PERSON) robinson(PERSON) a “ hero ” . 

mr sunak on friday(DATE) , in an address to the nation from downing street , warned that extremist forces in britain(GPE) were “ trying to tear us apart ” . 

he said islamist(NORP) extremists and far - right groups “ are spreading a poison ” in the uk as he called for unity and social cohesion .

i - developed - cancer - on - my - legs - after - insect - bite - double - amputee - businessman : 

senior citizen and businessman , amidu(PERSON) oyebanji(PERSON) , whose legs were amputated after being diagnosed with kaposi(PERSON) sarcoma , shares his story with ajibade omape 

what is your background ? 

my name is akande amidu(PERSON) oyebanji(PERSON) , i am from oyo(ORG) state(ORG) , where i was born and got all my education . i was born in ibadan(GPE) on april(DATE) 27(DATE) ,(DATE) 1967(DATE) . i am from a family of muslims(NORP) . 

why were your legs amputated ? 

i was diagnosed with a type of cancer called kaposi(PERSON) sarcoma by doctors at the(ORG) university(ORG) college(ORG) hospital(ORG) , ibadan(GPE) , and i was advised by the doctors that if i wanted to live , my leg had to be cut off because it was infected with kaposi(PERSON) sarcoma . at the time , i had an insect bite on my left leg and it was that leg that was first(ORDINAL) cut off ; however , my right leg got amputated almost(DATE) three(DATE) years(DATE) later(DATE) after the same symptoms resurfaced . 

in your video on social media , you mentioned that you suffered an insect bite on your toe . what happened after that ? 

about(DATE) six(DATE) years(DATE) ago(DATE) , i had an insect bite on the toe of my left leg ; it was tiny just like when someone gets bitten by a mosquito , and it was not painful so i did not pay attention to it and i continued with my work and life was going smoothly ; it later became a little boil on the toe and grew bigger as time went by . i then decided to pop it with a pin hoping that the pus and blood in it would come out so that it could heal perfectly . days(DATE) later(DATE) , i noticed that the injury was a little damp so i started to nurse it and clean it up . i went to baptist(ORG) hospital(ORG) in ogbomoso(LOC) where i was given medications to use and also taught how to clean it up . 

after a while , my wife , who is also a health worker , noticed that the surface was getting wider so she advised me to go to the hospital because the wound was not healing . i went back to the hospital where i saw a young doctor who was a junior doctor in the department , who advised me to go to a bigger hospital to get proper care . i was confused as to why but he advised that i either go to the teaching hospital in ilorin or the(ORG) university(ORG) college(ORG) hospital(ORG) in ibadan(GPE) ; i decided to go to ibadan(GPE) since that was where i have lived all my life , so the doctor wrote a referral letter for me that i took to the uch where we conducted a series of tests , samples were taken from the open wound and taken to the laboratory . 

it took three(DATE) months(DATE) before the result was out and that was when i was told that i had kaposi(PERSON) sarcoma . my family was sad , so we opted for local remedies , consultation , and herbs to treat it for about(CARDINAL) four(CARDINAL) to(CARDINAL) five(CARDINAL) months(CARDINAL) , but there was no solution so i went back to the hospital where i was advised that the leg would have to be amputated if i wanted to save my life . i agreed saying if that was the will of god for me , so be it . on september(DATE) 29(DATE) ,(DATE) 2019(DATE) , my left leg was amputated as a result of kaposi(PERSON) sarcoma . after it had been amputated , i received treatment and started using crutches ; i was told not to come to the hospital again because my system was clean . 

when it was about(DATE) two(DATE) years(DATE) and seven(DATE) months(DATE) after my left leg was amputated , the second(ORDINAL) leg started showing similar symptoms to the first(ORDINAL) ; i sought traditional treatment again to find out if it was the same issue as the first(ORDINAL) , but all efforts did n’t yield the desired result , so we went back to the uch where they diagnosed kaposi(PERSON) sarcoma and the doctors said they would have to cut off the second(ORDINAL) leg to save my life , i agreed and that was how the second(ORDINAL) leg was amputated on september(DATE) 3(DATE) ,(DATE) 2022(DATE) . 

what job were you doing before losing your legs ? 

i am a businessman , and i used to travel to neighbouring countries dealing in foodstuffs like rice , beans , and so on . i have not been able to do business again because mobility is one of the issues that i am facing . i used to go from lagos(GPE) to cotonou(PERSON) and other neighbouring countries . i went to cotonou(PERSON) through the lagos route and i ended up in sokoto(GPE) ; it was part of the business 

what about your wife and children ? 

my wife is very fine ; she has stood by me ever since this incident occurred ; she did not leave me to myself , and my children as well have been very supportive . i thank god that they are all in good health and they have been with me ever since . they are the reason i still have hope . 

have your siblings supported you when you lost your legs ? 

yes , my siblings have supported me in every way . even my younger ones are instrumental in my upkeep and i ’m very grateful to them for their support . 

you mentioned that you were diagnosed with kaposi(PERSON) sarcoma , how did you get it ? 

well , like i said earlier , my left foot just started getting bigger after the insect bite . i have never broken a bone or nail since i was born , i am always very careful so i am sure i did not contract it from an infected person although , according to the doctors , i can say that the kaposi(PERSON) sarcoma was as a result of the wound on my foot , which was from an insect bite , and at the time i got bit by the insect , i did not even feel it so i had no idea when i got bitten ; the opening was as tiny as that of a mark made by an injection needle . 

what kind of job do you hope to do now ? 

the first(ORDINAL) thing is to get properly taken care of because there is nothing on the ground at the moment ; if you remember from the video on the internet , i mentioned that i wanted to buy artificial legs and the legs will cost about(MONEY) n3(MONEY) m(MONEY) ; i also need to go through physiotherapy , which will also cost a lot . i have been blessed by god(PERSON) ; i previously owned a truck that i once gave to a driver , but at the moment , i do not have it again because when the sickness came , i spent everything i had on it , and there is nothing left right now ; i am just grateful that my wife can support me as i ca n’t do anything for now . 

have you ever attempted suicide because of what happened ? 

no , i have never thought of it ; i can never do such a thing . i love my wife and i love my children as well so i can not even dream of it . i ca n’t leave them to suffer in this world , however , because of my human nature i feel sad sometimes . but i ca n’t do such a thing to myself , so even if i do n’t have money , i have my wife and children . i do n’t fall sick often , although about(DATE) seven(DATE) days(DATE) after the ramadan fasting , i usually have malaria , but once my wife gives me chloroquine injection and paracetamol and i fall asleep , i would be alright after a(DATE) few(DATE) days(DATE) and it could take till the(DATE) following(DATE) year(DATE) before(DATE) i(DATE) fall(DATE) sick again . but i only take this as my fate . 

as a result of your condition , will you say you are depressed ? 

to be very honest , i am human so i feel sad sometimes when i think about it . sometimes i want to go out but i ca n’t because i have no legs to move ; i have clothes in my wardrobe that i can not wear because i can not go anywhere , i just shuffle between two(CARDINAL) pieces of clothes because there is nowhere i am wearing my other clothes too ; so yes , i feel sad sometimes when i also remember the places i have travelled to for business 

you mentioned in your video that you needed to wash your internal organs , is it as a result of the cancer ? 

at the moment , i am no longer in control of my body , so i am always acting on the instructions of the doctors . according to the doctors , the cancer did not spread past my legs so i am safe ; however , cancer is a disease that can not be predicted . i had 10(CARDINAL) chemotherapy sessions , but the doctors said physiotherapy is important for me to be rest assured that my system is free of the cancer . 

how have your friends and other people treated you since your legs were cut off ? 

honestly , people change with time . some of the people , whom i used to do business with and who even owe me , and have seen my present condition , do not even respond to my calls again ; most times when you call these people , all you will hear are prayers and they do n’t even wish to pay up the money they owe ; humans will always be humans . 

how do you manage to get around and do things ? do you have someone assisting you ? 

i mostly crawl ; i do n’t even have a wheelchair . i ca n’t even get a wheelchair because it will require someone to be available to assist me , but my children have different lives to live . coping is not easy but my wife tries her best and every other person around like my children and siblings also try their best to support me , that is one of the reasons why i posted a video on the internet , just like people advised that i speak up hoping that i could get help . 

have you been cured of kaposi(PERSON) sarcoma ? 

only god knows what we do n’t know ; according to doctors , cancer is a disease that can not be predicted , and they have also said that there are no signs of cancer in my system again . however , the doctors advised that i go for physiotherapy so that i can thoroughly rid my body of it and be sure that it is completely out of my system . but yes , there is no cancer in my system anymore as i speak to you . 

you mentioned that you lost about(CARDINAL) 500(CARDINAL) bags of rice to the customs , have you been able to get them back ? 

this happened about(DATE) three(DATE) years(DATE) ago(DATE) at the time when the government said that we should not import rice into the country and there was no other way for us to convey it ; we did not steal it so we could not throw it away , and of course , there is no way the customs will return goods that they seize from you ; i can say that it was part of the rice that was sold cheaply to members of the public and those goods are what we use to feed our families . 

you said you needed n2 m for physiotherapy , how much have you realised from that amount ? 

honestly , i have realised a part of the money meant for physiotherapy . i have realised a total of n1,650,000(PRODUCT) so i am left with a balance of n350,000(GPE) for the physiotherapy , i also need n3,000,000(PERSON) for artifical legs so i would be able to move around . 

having artificial legs will be better than a wheelchair because someone who has a wheelchair has to employ an assistant , but with the artificial legs , i will be able to move about freely and do a lot of things by myself . it will cost about(MONEY) n3(MONEY) m(MONEY) to get one(CARDINAL) but i have not seen anything for that one yet . getting an artificial leg will enable me to move about and get my job done efficiently . 

what support do you need at the moment ? 

i would love people to help me get the necessary things that i need . i am not picky at the moment as beggars ca n’t be choosers , and i also understand the current situation of the country and how it is affecting everybody . i ca n’t ask people to donate money for my physiotherapy and still ask them for money to start a business , i just want help to sort out the physiotherapy bills and get the artificial legs . i just want to take good care of myself and i hope people can support me in any way that they can .

24157533.ross(CARDINAL) - urges - pro - union - voters - back - tories - election : 

douglas(PERSON) ross(PERSON) has appealed to supporters of the union to vote tactically to ditch “ dud ” first(ORDINAL) minister humza(PERSON) yousaf(PERSON) . 

the scottish(NORP) conservative leader is due to address his party ’s conference in aberdeen(GPE) this(TIME) morning(TIME) . 

in his speech , he is expected to say that any pro - uk voter who wants to " kick the nationalists out " will need to back his party . 

labour disagreed , with dame jackie(PERSON) baillie(PERSON) calling the tories a " gift for the snp . "

thanks to the defection of lisa(PERSON) cameron(PERSON) from the snp(ORG) , mr ross(PERSON) 's party currently has seven(CARDINAL) mps . senior figures in the party are confident that they can keep hold of the seats they won in 2019(DATE) , and possibly even gain a handful more . 

speaking at a fringe event last(TIME) night(TIME) , mr ross(PERSON) said there would be a " very different election here in scotland(GPE) . " 

" there 's a lot to be positive about in the scottish(NORP) conservatives , " he added . " we will be fighting to retain the seats we 've got and win more . i think we can have a(TIME) good(TIME) night(TIME) on election(TIME) night(TIME) . " 

however , the polling is grim for them . 

a recent survey of 1,043(CARDINAL) people in scotland(GPE) by survation(ORG) put the snp on 38(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) , labour on 33(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) and the scottish(NORP) tories on 15(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) , their lowest level since liz(PERSON) truss(PERSON) 's(PERSON) time in office . 

in his speech , mr ross(PERSON) will claim that mr yousaf(PERSON) ’s “ days in office are numbered , ” suggesting that a bad general election result for the snp will force him to resign . 

“ the knives are being sharpened , not just across the country but within his own party as well . 

“ even the snp are starting to realise that humza(PERSON) yousaf(PERSON) is a dud . ” 

mr ross(PERSON) will argue that if the “ pro - uk majority ” in key seats “ unites and votes together ” , then the tories can “ beat the nationalists up and down scotland ” . 

he will insist : “ we can make sure it ’s not only a bad night for the snp , but a terrible night for humza(PERSON) yousaf(PERSON) .(PERSON) 

“ if we vote together in those crucial snp(NORP) -(NORP) scottish(NORP) conservative seats , it wo n’t be a campervan that humza(PERSON) yousaf(PERSON) needs , it will be a removal van . ”

scottish(NORP) labour deputy leader dame jackie(PERSON) baillie(PERSON) said “ douglas(PERSON) ross(PERSON) and his party are out of touch , out of ideas , and quickly running out of time . ” 

she added : “ this tory party is a disaster for working people and a gift for the snp , delivering years(DATE) of political turmoil and economic misery . 

“ the tories and the snp have worked hand - in - hand to stoke the politics of division in an attempt to distract from their own woeful record in government . ” 

an snp(ORG) spokesperson said : “ this latest spiel from douglas(PERSON) ross(PERSON) proves he ’s as out of touch with reality as he is with the people of scotland(GPE) – who have not voted for a tory government in his lifetime . 

“ let ’s not forget , douglas(PERSON) ross(PERSON) stayed silent while his tory pals in westminster(GPE) drove the uk(GPE) economy off a cliff , dished out dodgy ppe(ORG) contracts to their pals and partied through lockdown , while the people of scotland stayed home to save lives . 

“ this(ORG) tory(ORG) uk(ORG) government(ORG) has been mired in corruption from the very beginning and , with latest polls showing a conservative wipe - out at the next general election , it ’s clear that scotland(GPE) is more than ready to boot the tories out once and for all . 

“ only a vote for the snp(ORG) will deliver a tory - free scotland(GPE) , and put scotland(GPE) ’s priorities first(ORDINAL) with independence . ”

the(PERSON) -(PERSON) iss(PERSON) - has - sprung - an - air - leak - but - nasa(ORG) - says - theres - no - need - to - panic : 

russia(GPE) 's space agency said on wednesday(DATE) that its section of the international space station is again suffering an air leak issue , but said the problem currently poses no threat to its crew . 

" indeed , specialists are detecting an air leak on board the iss , " the press service of roscosmos(ORG) said on wednesday(DATE) , per a translation by interfax . 

" there is no threat to crewmembers or the station itself , " roscosmos added . 

space officials said russian(NORP) crew are " regularly " working to identify and fix potential leaks on the iss , per state media agency tass(ORG) . 

the announcement came shortly after national(ORG) american(ORG) space(ORG) agency(ORG) iss program manager joel(PERSON) montalbano(PERSON) on the(DATE) same(DATE) day(DATE) reported an air leak in russia(GPE) 's zvezda life support module during a press briefing for the new crew-8 mission . 

according to montalbano , the leak is small but growing . 

" there is an area at the end of the international space station that we 've seen a leak . there is a small leak . we saw a leak increase about(DATE) a(DATE) week(DATE) before the recent progress launch and docking , " he said . 

montalbano added that nasa(ORG) was working with roscosmos on the issue and that the leak is neither affecting crew safety nor disrupting the crew-8 mission , which aims to send four(CARDINAL) astronauts to the iss(NORP) . 

nasa(ORG) and roscosmos(ORG) found an air leak in russia(GPE) 's side of the iss in august(DATE) 2020(DATE) . it was in the zvezda module , which provides critical life support like oxygen and water . 

this leak source was identified in october(DATE) 2020(DATE) and temporarily patched up , but another possible leak spot was found in november(DATE) 2021(DATE) by russian(NORP) cosmonaut pyotr(PERSON) dubrov(PERSON) . 

roscosmos(ORG) said in january(DATE) 2022(DATE) that the " last air leak " location in the zvezda had been discovered and would be fixed . 

however , the announcement on wednesday(DATE) indicates that the problem has resurfaced . 

russia(GPE) is set to pull out of the iss after 2024(DATE) , moscow(GPE) said in july(DATE) 2022(DATE) , at a time when the us(GPE) announced sanctions targeting russian(NORP) leadership because of the war in ukraine(GPE) .(GPE) 

the station has been one(CARDINAL) of the last remaining points of cooperation between roscosmos and nasa(ORG) , which hopes to continue operating the aging station until 2030(DATE) . 

meanwhile , roscosmos(ORG) said it plans to build its own space station , following the example of china(GPE) 's independent tiangong station . 

as moscow(GPE) continues to split from the west , russian(NORP) space officials have questioned the reliability of the old equipment on board the iss(NORP) .

albany(GPE) , ga(ORG) . ( walb ) - it ’s time to recognize a military hero in south(GPE) georgia(GPE) who served our country and now serves the community . 

air(ORG) force(ORG) flight medical officer dr(PERSON) .(PERSON) george(PERSON) chastain(PERSON) took three(DATE) years(DATE) out of his training during post - grad at emory to go into the air force , but little did he know his mission would change . 

“ i went to vietnam(GPE) and i did what i was supposed to do , but there was a lot of time to do something else , or i could ’ve done a lot of things , ” chastain(ORG) said . 

however , chastain(ORG) chose to visit the orphanage and regularly give needed medical aid to children . the former physician went into the air force and served two(DATE) years(DATE) stateside and was then sent to vietnam(GPE) to serve as a flight medical officer but it was the work he did while he was n’t in the air that impacted him most . 

“ it was a breath of fresh air to me as much as it was anything else because i saw kind , gentle people , ” he said . 

chastain(PERSON) was impressed by the dedication of the nuns who operated the orphanage but also how ill - equipped they were to practice medicine . 

“ i had to be very careful because if i told them something , that they should do it , next thing i know while i was talking they were out there doing it . i mean they just reacted that fast , ” he said . 

being away from his family was difficult , but he cared for the children as if they were his own . 

“ they meant the world to me , and for a long period of time , they were my world , ” chastain(ORG) said . 

when dr . chastain(PERSON) came back home , much like many others who serve in the armed forces suffered from ptsd(GPE) , one(CARDINAL) of the darkest moments in his life . but still , he clung to his faith . 

“ guys over there were losing their faith in their god , it helped me regain mine and that was very important to me , ” chastain(ORG) said .

- 

usawa(ORG) agenda executive director emmanuel(PERSON) manyasa(PERSON) said the payment a tutor receives speaks on their motivation to teach learners . 

- 

manyasa(ORG) said most schools are facing the challenge of sourcing funds to pay the bom teachers . 

eight(CARDINAL) in every 10(CARDINAL) board of management teachers goes home with less than sh10,000 at the(DATE) end(DATE) of(DATE) the(DATE) month(DATE) , a report has revealed . 

the finding came during the launch of a report titled , “ the foundational literacy and numeracy assessment ( flana(PERSON) ) report 2023(DATE) " on thursday(DATE) at kicd(ORG) in nairobi(GPE) . 

the report also showed that two(CARDINAL) in every bom teacher earns between sh10,000 and sh20,000(ORG) at the(DATE) end(DATE) of(DATE) the(DATE) month(DATE) . 

one(CARDINAL) in 100(CARDINAL) bom teachers earns between sh20,000(ORG) and sh30,000(NORP) monthly(DATE) . 

additionally , the report showed that sources of funds for payment of bom teachers mostly come from parents of the schools . 

usawa(ORG) agenda executive director emmanuel(PERSON) manyasa(PERSON) said the payment a tutor receives speaks on their motivation to teach learners . 

manyasa(ORG) said most schools are facing the challenge of sourcing funds to pay the bom teachers , who are critical to ensuring the delivery of quality education . 

“ the government should consider factoring in money for bom teachers because parents are not always able to . the source from which the bom teachers are paid comes from parents nationally , ” manyasa(ORG) said . 

the report showed that sh67(ORG) in sh100 paid to bom teachers comes from parents . 

sh70(GPE) in sh100 paid to bom teachers in rural areas come from parents . 

" sh60 in sh100 paid to bom teachers in urban areas come from parents , " the report read in part . 

interestingly , only sh6.7 in sh100 paid to bom teachers comes from government capitation . 

the flana(PERSON) report also showed that sh7 in sh100 paid to bom teachers in rural areas comes from government capitation . 

government capitation only contributes to sh6.2 in sh100 paid to bom teachers in urban areas . 

the reports come after usawa agenda between(DATE) june(DATE) and(DATE) july(DATE) 2023(DATE) visited 1,953(CARDINAL) villages spread across all counties and interviewed 38,634(CARDINAL) household heads reaching 59,201(CARDINAL) children . 

usawa(ORG) agenda also visited 1,813(CARDINAL) primary schools - both public and private and engaged with learners to find out if they were truly learning . 

further , the report showed that regions with few teachers on permanent and pensionable terms have more learners staying out of school than those with more permanent teachers . 

manyasa(ORG) said regions like wajir(PRODUCT) with few teachers on permanent and pensionable terms have the highest number of learners out of school . 

the report showed wajir(ORG) county(ORG) has the lowest percentage of p(ORG) and p(ORG) teachers constituting 63(CARDINAL) in 100(CARDINAL) of their teachers . 

kirinyaga(GPE) county(GPE) has the highest percentage of p(ORG) and p(ORG) teachers constituting 93(CARDINAL) in 100(CARDINAL) of their teachers .

287(CARDINAL) - 53bd257a-3026 - 42b1(CARDINAL) - 94f0 - d1518e75c7b1 : 

dallas(GPE) — 

on friday(DATE) , empower , a private company contracted by the state , will fully takeover managing the foster care system for nine(CARDINAL) north(GPE) texas(GPE) counties . 

this will be the second(ORDINAL) phase of the transition to community - based care , which is the state ’s term for private foster care , for dallas(GPE) , collin(GPE) , ellis(ORG) ,(ORG) rockwall(ORG) , kaufman(PERSON) , hunt(GPE) , fannin(GPE) and navarro counties . in this phase , empower , will assume full case management and placement responsibility for all of the children in the region who have been removed from their homes because of abuse and neglect and are in the state ’s custody . 

transitioning to a private system 

in the first(ORDINAL) phase , which went into effect sept(DATE) .(DATE) 1(DATE) ,(DATE) 2023(DATE) , empower took over administrative payments to the child placing agencies and other providers that had had been contracted by the state to provide placement services for foster children . empower also began placing children who entered the state ’s custody after sept(DATE) .(DATE) 1(DATE) . 

the self - titled “ child welfare collaborative ” is a network made up of large nonprofit organizations that have been providing foster care , adoption , residential treatment and behavioral health services for vulnerable children in north(GPE) texas(GPE) for decades(DATE) . those organization , which have historically been contracted by the state of texas(GPE) , will now operate under empower ’s umbrella organization . 

community - based care , or cbc , was introduced by texas(GPE) lawmakers as a solution to the legacy state - run foster care system that ’s historically been plagued with problems and is currently tied up in a 13(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) -(DATE) long(DATE) legal battle in which a federal judge ruled that the state of texas(GPE) was violating the constitutional rights of foster care children by placing them in a systemically dangerous system . 

the goal of cbc(ORG) is for non - profit organizations to provide placement and care options to foster children on a localized , region - by - region basis . 

region 3e(CARDINAL) 

region 3e(CARDINAL) is the largest region the state has transitioned to private care . 

“ we ’re responsible for 2,000(CARDINAL) children on any(DATE) given(DATE) day(DATE) whereas the state is responsible for over(CARDINAL) 10,000(CARDINAL) children on any(DATE) given(DATE) day(DATE) , ” empower senior vice president linda(PERSON) garcia(PERSON) said . “ i feel really confident that community - based care is the right thing to do because we are able to concentrate on paying attention to the children that are in this community . ” 

garcia(PERSON) said the state has been moving children to empower ’s care in groups . last(DATE) september(DATE) , the(DATE) first(DATE) month(DATE) of empower ’s first(ORDINAL) phase , dr . garcia(PERSON) said more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 300(CARDINAL) children in paid foster care were transitioned to the company ’s care as(CARDINAL) well(CARDINAL) as(CARDINAL) 112(CARDINAL) children who had been newly removed from their homes . each(DATE) month(DATE) since , groups of a(CARDINAL) few(CARDINAL) hundred(CARDINAL) have been transitioned . 

the last group to be moved over , garcia(PERSON) said , will be children who are living with family and loved ones and children living in specialized living situations . she said that group will be moved over by march(DATE) 1(DATE) , when phase 2(CARDINAL) goes into effect . 

however , while the process of transitioning the children to the new system , one of the greatest concerns about the process from critics of cbc is about empower ’s ability to recruit and retain the experienced child protective services workers who have historically worked for the state . 

staffing concerns 

last(DATE) year(DATE) , dfps(PERSON) told wfaa(ORG) that 450(CARDINAL) of the state ’s more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 700(CARDINAL) jobs in region 3e(CARDINAL) would be moved to empower , meaning that the people in those positions would have to either go to work for empower or find other jobs . 

one(CARDINAL) caseworker , with nearly(DATE) 20(DATE) years(DATE) of experience with dfps , said going private is a major change for herself and her colleagues . 

“ i know there are some people who are forcing themselves to be positive about it because it ’s one(CARDINAL) of those ‘ i ’m going to go into this with a positive mindset and hope for the best ’ , but i do n’t know anyone who is genuinely excited , ” she said . 

the woman said she and her colleagues have been attending town hall - style informational meetings hosted by empower to prepare for the transition , but it has not improved confidence in the system for her or coworkers she ’s spoken with . 

“ it ’s hard to put faith in it when it comes from empower because they ’ve broken every promise that they ’ve made to us , ” she said . 

the caseworkers and other dfps employees are planning to start working for empower on march(DATE) 1(DATE) told wfaa(ORG) that they are taking great financial losses by moving to empower . 

“ we were told that we ’d get pay and benefits that were comparable to what we ’d get with the state and that did not happen , ” the caseworker said . “ it is because of the insurance . right now , the state pays for our insurance . empower , sometimes they ’re matching workers ’ pay . sometimes they ’re offering less , and then we have to pay for our own insurance . " 

in her case , the base pay was matched , but she said she ’s taking a financial hit of about(MONEY) $(MONEY) 13,000(MONEY) in insurance payments . 

“ for some workers , that is going to be a destroying factor , ” she said . 

a supervisor with more(DATE) than(DATE) 20(DATE) years(DATE) of experience with the department told wfaa(ORG) that she is going to work for empower because she feels like she does n’t have a choice . she said that she ’s accumulated multiple months work of paid sick time that she will lose and wo n’t be compensated for . 

“ the people that are going are doing it because they want to stay with their kids , ” the caseworker said . “ some are going for the money because they do n’t have any better options . ” 

when empower entered its first(ORDINAL) phase of this transition last(DATE) september(DATE) , both garcia(PERSON) and leaders with the state admitted that the transition was going to be difficult for staff who have grown accustomed to state pay and benefits . they also admitted it was n’t likely a private nonprofit would be able to compete with state compensation for every employee . 

for garcia(PERSON) , it ’s still a high priority . 

“ we have been busy trying to recruit the department of family and protective services caseworkers , to task them to come over to us , ” garcia(PERSON) said . “ that ’s been weekly(DATE) rounds of interviews and trying to get them to come over to us . ” 

wfaa(ORG) submitted an open records request with dfps for data on what the people in the 450(CARDINAL) jobs going to empower were choosing to do . 

from february(DATE) 2023(DATE) , which is when the state awarded empower its contract , to january(DATE) 8(DATE) of(DATE) this(DATE) year(DATE) , 123(CARDINAL) staff members opted to go to empower , 14(DATE) retired , 15(CARDINAL) people transferred to other state agencies and 71(CARDINAL) transferred within dfps . 

the state did not provide the number of people who resigned , despite that being part of the requested for information . the state also did not respond to follow - up questions about the more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 200(CARDINAL) positions that were not accounted for in the data provided . 

empower said wednesday(DATE) that it ’s hired 339(CARDINAL) new staff members for its second(ORDINAL) stage , with “ around(CARDINAL) 250(CARDINAL) ” started in march(DATE) 1(DATE) . of those 339(CARDINAL) positions , empower said 147(CARDINAL) of the people hired are caseworkers and 34(CARDINAL) of them are support staff hired to assist caseworkers . 

the company said it still has 75(CARDINAL) open positions to fill . 

“ it ’s extremely important for us to have all these individuals with this experience , ” garcia(PERSON) said . “ they know their cases . they know the children . they know the families . they know the community . ” 

the caseworker who spoke with wfaa(ORG) said she is concerned about empower filling positions with people who are less experienced . 

“ we do n’t know who ’s training the new people coming to empower , ” she said . “ we do n’t know what training they ’re receiving . kids will run away when they do n’t feel cared for . worse things can happen when they do n’t feel cared for . ” 

garcia(PERSON) said training programs are in place for new staff . she said empower is hiring for “ every supportive position you can think of ” . 

the caseworker who spoke with wfaa(ORG) for this story said that she already has more cases than the state recommends per caseworker , and she has already received an additional case from a unit where both the supervisor and caseworker have left the department . she is concerned that caseworkers will see higher caseloads as people choose to either not go to empower , or to leave shortly after the transition . 

dr . garcia(PERSON) said empower is working to prepare for that possibility . 

“ what we want to do is over hire just in case because sometimes life changes for these case workers , ” garcia(PERSON) said . “ they may decide they want to remain in the region or they make go somewhere else . ” 

placing children 

in addition to compensation and hiring concerns , caseworkers who spoke with wfaa(ORG) said they are already noticing children being placed in homes and facilities that are outside of region 3e(CARDINAL) . 

“ community - based care is supposed to be about keeping your kids in their community , and they ’re not , ” a caseworker said . “ i ’ve had kids go out of region ... i’ve had two(CARDINAL) that have gone out of region just(DATE) this(DATE) year(DATE) just since december(DATE) . ” 

dr . garcia(PERSON) admitted that more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) half(CARDINAL) of the providers that empower has brought into its network are outside of the nine(CARDINAL) counties of region 3e(CARDINAL) . 

" i ’ve got 160(CARDINAL) in our network but , of that , probably about(CARDINAL) 60(CARDINAL) of them are within the counties in our region , ” garcia(PERSON) said . 

caseworkers said that ’s “ another broken promise ” from empower . 

“ they flat out said ‘ we are not going to place kids out of region , ’ ” a caseworker said . 

one(CARDINAL) of the state ’s performance measures for empower is the percentage of children who are placed within 50(QUANTITY) miles(QUANTITY) of their home . 

“ they can be not in the region and within 50(QUANTITY) miles(QUANTITY) , ” garcia(PERSON) said . 

what ’s next ? will it work ? 

empower will be required to report to dfps in a number of performance measures and will have to meet certain standards in order to maintain its contract with the state . 

“ i ’ve seen improvement in the system every since community - based care was launched in 2013(DATE) , " garcia(PERSON) said . “ i ’ve had the luxury to be in the system from 2013(DATE) on , and community - based care has a way to target the problem and really work . ” 

garcia(PERSON) was in a leadership position with our community our kids ( ocok ) when the organization was awarded the state ’s first(ORDINAL) contract to privatize foster care in region 3w(CARDINAL) which is made up of tarrant(GPE) , parker(ORG) , hood , johnson(PERSON) , somervell(ORG) , palo(GPE) pinto(GPE) and erath counties . in april(DATE) , ocok will add children in denton(GPE) , wise and cookie counties to its care . 

however , some of the caseworkers who spoke with wfaa(ORG) said they are concerned about how the system will work in dallas(GPE) county(GPE) . 

“ it ’s too big , ” a caseworker said . “ fannin(GPE) , navarro(ORG) , ellis ... maybe they ’ll succeed with them , but i do n’t know anybody that has a hope for success in dallas(GPE) . ” 

despite cbc being in place for more(DATE) than(DATE) a(DATE) decade(DATE) in the western part of north(GPE) texas(GPE) , she said many caseworkers are weary after watching it fail in in the san(GPE) antonio(GPE) area . in 2021(DATE) , just(DATE) about(DATE) two(DATE) years(DATE) after the state awarded a contract to the children ’s shelter to takeover foster care in bexar(GPE) county(GPE) , the organization cancelled its contract with the state after the state opened an investigation into a number of issues including violent episodes , sexual assaults and lack of supervision for kids . 

“ a lot of workers are expecting it kind of go the way bexar count went where the outlying counties are able to stay under a company , but the major metropolitan areas was not , ” a caseworker said . 

she said none of the colleagues she ’s spoken with expect privatized care to be a success in region 3e(CARDINAL) -- but they want to be proven wrong . 

“ we want empower to succeed , ” a caseworker said . “ we know the system is broken . we know the department ’s not the best parents ... we want empower to be the solution to our problems . ” 

when asked how the public will know if cbc works for this region , garcia(PERSON) said the reports empower will provide to the state and the community will make it clear . 

“ the data will speak for itself , ” garcia(PERSON) said .

remembering moorehead(PERSON) : the story of lakeland(GPE) ’s erased black community 

lakeland(GPE) , fla(GPE) . ( wfla(GPE) ) -the moorehead(PERSON) community was a bustling neighborhood in lakeland(GPE) for african(NORP) -(NORP) americans(NORP) before desegregation , but nothing remains from the historic town . 

“ willie pearl , ” audrey(PERSON) figgs(PERSON) said . 

“ that would have been here ? ” wfla(ORG) ’s deanne(PERSON) king(PERSON) asked . 

“ that would have been right here , ” she replied . 

audrey(PERSON) figgs(PERSON) , 75(DATE) , remembers the moorehead(PERSON) community as though it was still there . 

“ i can hear my mother right now standing on the porch , ivory(GPE) , ann(GPE) , dawn , audrey(PERSON) and mary(PERSON) , ” figgs(NORP) recalled . “ we had to run through the path to come up and eat everyday at 5(TIME) o’clock(TIME) my mother would call . ” 

figgs(NORP) grew up in moorehead(GPE) , which is where the first(ORDINAL) black school and church were built in lakeland(GPE) . 

“ in 1954(DATE) i went to first(ORDINAL) grade at moorehead(ORG) elementary , ” she said . 

west of downtown lakeland(GPE) , african(NORP) americans(NORP) moved to the 35(QUANTITY) -(QUANTITY) acre(QUANTITY) moorehead(GPE) community in the(DATE) 1800s(DATE) to work on the railroad . roads like lime street , orange street and sycamore street were filled with black - owned businesses , churches and schools . 

“ i remember mt . sinai primitive baptist(ORG) church(ORG) simply because that ’s where we played , ” figgs(NORP) said . “ that was the playground . ” 

in the(DATE) late(DATE) 1960s(DATE) after desegregation , moorehead(ORG) residents were able to visit places they were once not allowed . 

“ i can remember my sister mary(PERSON) telling my momma , ‘ momma , momma look at audrey(PERSON) , she ’s over there drinking that white water , ' ” figgs(NORP) recalled . 

however , shortly after desegregation in 1971(DATE) , the city of lakeland(GPE) purchased moorehead(ORG) using eminent domain to build an auditorium , which is now the rp funding center . 

“ the people were not satisfied , ” figgs(NORP) said . “ they had been on that land since the(DATE) early(DATE) 1800s(DATE) . you just uproot people and move them ? i ’m baffled today(DATE) , i still do n’t understand why mt(GPE) . sinai primitive baptist(ORG) church(ORG) had to go , but yet wonn(GPE) is still there . to me , that ’s blatant discrimination . ” 

wonn(GPE) is a radio station that has been operating since 1949(DATE) . while that was never touched , many families were forced to relocate to areas like westlake(GPE) in lakeland(GPE) . 

“ i was kind of sad to see it go like that because we were one(CARDINAL) big family , ” louise(PERSON) smith(PERSON) said . “ now you drive through here and all you see is cement . ” 

louise(PERSON) smith(PERSON) , 81(DATE) , also grew up in moorehead(GPE) . she moved to the area at 16(CARDINAL) after growing up in georgia(GPE) . 

“ we would have to work the fields in georgia(GPE) , but here i was a cook for my dad , ” smith(PERSON) recalled . “ moorehead(PERSON) was a family . i miss it . ” 

those stories and memories of moorehead now live on through people like figgs(NORP) and smith(ORG) .(ORG) 

“ for people who might not know the story of moorehead(PERSON) , or know that moorehead(PERSON) existed , after learning about it , what do you hope their take away is ? ” wfla(ORG) ’s deanne(PERSON) king(PERSON) asked smith(PERSON) . 

“ that they will value more of where they are at and let them know what people had to give up , ” she said . 

the city of lakeland(GPE) memorialized the moorehead(PERSON) community with a plaque at the now rp funding center . there are archives and photos in the lakeland(GPE) library as well .

navalny(PERSON) 's mother lyudmila was among the mourners , visiting her son 's grave for the(DATE) second(DATE) day(DATE) , accompanied by the mother of alexei 's widow yulia . both women , dressed in black , stood quietly at the grave , before leaving . 

navalny , who was president vladimir(PERSON) putin(PERSON) 's fiercest critic inside russia(GPE) , died at the(DATE) age(DATE) of(DATE) 47(DATE) in an arctic(LOC) penal colony on feb(DATE) .(DATE) 16(DATE) . supporters said he had been murdered . the kremlin(ORG) has denied any state involvement in his death . 

thousands(CARDINAL) of people attended a farewell ceremony for navalny on friday(DATE) , with some chanting his name and saying they would not forgive the russian(NORP) authorities for his death . 

by saturday(DATE) , the grave in a moscow(GPE) cemetery not for from where he once lived was covered with flowers left by thousands(CARDINAL) of mourners . 

" he was the one who had opened my eyes to the existing political situation in russia(GPE) , " one(CARDINAL) mourner , who did not give her name , said of navalny , who rose to prominence with blogs exposing what he said was vast corruption in the russian(NORP) elite . 

" i followed all of his investigations closely . i showed them to my friends who were not very interested ( in politics ) . i tried to show them to my parents , but that was more difficult . i love truth , i love honesty , and i 'm very happy when truth wins . " 

the kremlin(ORG) dismissed navalny 's accusations of corruption and his accusations that putin(PERSON) had vast personal wealth . navalny 's movement is outlawed and most of his senior allies have fled russia(GPE) and now live in europe(LOC) . 

police look on 

another mourner visited the grave " to honour the memory of the man who has become a symbol of perseverance for me . and after what 's happened , there 's a feeling of a very deep sorrow . "

" he was a symbol . he was a huge symbol . despite everything , you can think of him whatever you want , but he has really become a symbol of something free and bright , of some kind of hope . " 

police looked on but did not interfere as mourners lay flowers at navalny 's grave on saturday(DATE) . 

a rights group , ovd - info , reported that 91(CARDINAL) people had been detained on friday(DATE) in 12(CARDINAL) towns and cities , including moscow(GPE) . it did not immediately report any new detentions on saturday(DATE) .

codi(PERSON) bigsby(PERSON) trial begins : the history of " no body " murder trials in virginia(GPE) 

- details 

- written by laura(PERSON) philion(PERSON) 

- category : local news 

- published : 01 march(DATE) 2024(DATE) 

cory(PERSON) bigsby(PERSON) goes on trial monday(DATE) , charged with the murder of his 4(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) -(DATE) old(DATE) son codi — even though no body has been found . whro(PERSON) spoke with former prosecutor and legal scholar laura(PERSON) killinger(PERSON) of william(ORG) &(ORG) mary(ORG) law(ORG) school(ORG) about the history of “ no body ” murder cases in virginia(GPE) . 

the following interview has been edited for length and clarity . 

whro(ORG) : let 's start with the basics . just how difficult is it to try a murder case with no body ? 

laura(PERSON) killinger(PERSON) : well , in any murder case , the prosecutor has to prove that a particular person died at the hands of another person and that the defendant is the one who did that . so in cases where there 's no body , the authorities have to prove that the alleged victim was actually killed and is n't just missing . so it is significantly more difficult than in a regular murder case where you have a body that can be examined by a coroner and that can be identified by loved ones later on as a person who is deceased , and where you can examine the body and determine the method of death . 

whro(ORG) : there are a few cases in virginia(GPE) that set a precedent for this one , including the 1980(DATE) case of the(ORG) radford(ORG) university(ORG) student(ORG) gina(PERSON) hall(PERSON) . it took about(DATE) 40(DATE) years(DATE) for her remains to be found , but steven(PERSON) epperly(PERSON) was convicted for her murder long before that . tell us more about how that case played out legally . 

lk : so that case was sort of a cutting edge case at the time , because it was the first(ORDINAL) ' no body ' case in virginia(GPE) . 

with that case , there was pretty much overwhelming circumstantial evidence . and it was prosecutors piecing together that circumstantial evidence of people who had seen epperly with gina(PERSON) renee(PERSON) hall(PERSON) , and then when they found bloodstains in the cabin , when they found fibers and things like that in the car of the trunk that was identified to connect to epperly . so there 's a lot of circumstantial evidence in that particular case that allowed prosecutors to prove beyond a reasonable doubt . 

there was no statement or confession by epperly , and in fact , epperly maintained his innocence . and despite that , he was convicted and sentenced to life . 

whro : what other kind of evidence can the prosecution present in that case or now in the bigsby case in 2024(DATE) ? are there differences ? 

lk : oh , definitely . certainly the developments in dna evidence have been revolutionary for the criminal justice system , both in identifying and convicting people who did do it , and in exonerating people who did not and who were wrongfully convicted of a crime . so that , of course , is a major factor and difference in these cases since that time . 

in addition , there 's been a lot more developments in other areas of forensic science . so for instance , identification of fibers , identification of hair samples and all kinds of things like that are much better . so there is quite a bit of different technology . 

now , you had mentioned the different types of evidence . circumstantial evidence is something that a lot of times your listeners may have heard about in passing . and there is this mistaken belief out there that circumstantial evidence is not good , and maybe it 's not even admissible , and that 's just simply not true . oftentimes , circumstantial evidence can be extremely helpful in these cases and is usually always admissible . 

whro : cory(PERSON) bigsby(PERSON) made written confessions in jail and then recanted them . a judge ruled in november(DATE) those were admissible . does that change anything about the way this trial would be handled ? 

lk : some people think , " oh gosh , there 's a confession or there 's a statement , is n't that , you know , the end of the story ? " but a good defense attorney can poke holes through a confession . and so as a prosecutor , they will need to find as much cooperating evidence that shows independently that whatever the defendant said the way they did it really is borne out by corroborating evidence , that they find either at the scene or afterward .

marcus(PERSON) osborne(PERSON) : domestic abuser who murdered ex - partner and new boyfriend days(DATE) after being released on bail given whole life order 

the killer had a history of domestic abuse and attacked his ex - partner katie(PERSON) higton(PERSON) after she told police he had threatened to " slit her throat " . 

friday(DATE) 1(DATE) march(DATE) 2024(DATE) 14:30(DATE) , uk(GPE) 

a man who stabbed to death his ex - partner and a man she was dating in a " ferocious and merciless " attack has been sentenced to a whole life order . 

marcus(PERSON) osborne(PERSON) murdered katie(PERSON) higton(PERSON) , 27(DATE) , and steven(PERSON) harnett(PERSON) , 25(DATE) , in may(DATE) last(DATE) year(DATE) . 

he forced his way into the home he used to share with ms(ORG) higton(ORG) in huddersfield(GPE) and attacked her as she returned from a date at a cinema . 

prosecutors said she put up a " courageous struggle " but suffered 99(CARDINAL) knife wounds , including more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 20(CARDINAL) to the face . 

osborne(PERSON) , 35(DATE) , then used her phone to lure mr harnett(PERSON) to the house , stabbing him 24(CARDINAL) times and leaving him with mutilated genitals . 

he also raped another woman who was at the house and held her at knifepoint overnight(TIME) . 

leeds(PERSON) crown(PERSON) court(PERSON) heard four(CARDINAL) children were in the property at the time , and that after the killings he said : " romeo(PERSON) and juliet(PERSON) can die together now . " 

he also invited neighbours to come to see the bodies , said sky correspondent frazer(PERSON) maude(PERSON) . 

as he was led away on friday(DATE) , a family member shouted : " i hope you rot in hell " , while a statement by ms(ORG) higton(ORG) 's(ORG) mother called osborne a " monster of the worst kind " . 

he now joins a list of britain(GPE) 's worst killers , such as rose west and milly(PERSON) dowler(PERSON) 's(PERSON) killer levi(PERSON) bellfield(PERSON) , who will never be released . 

the murders happened soon after ms(ORG) higton(ORG) ended her five(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) relationship with osborne following a domestic violence incident in late(DATE) april(DATE) . 

' motivated by sex ' 

ms higton visited the police station on 10(CARDINAL) may and told officers he regularly attacked her and was controlling and coercive . 

she told police that osborne(PERSON) had threatened to " slit her throat if she said what he had done " and that " if she ever got a boyfriend he would kill them both " . 

he was arrested two(DATE) days(DATE) later(DATE) on suspicion of domestic violence but released on bail and told not to return to the house or contact ms higton . 

he then spied on her before carrying out the killings on 15(CARDINAL) may .

the whole - life prisoners currently behind bars 

osborne(PERSON) , who also has convictions for violent offences against two(CARDINAL) previous partners in 2011(DATE) and 2012(DATE) , pleaded guilty to the murders as well as the rape . 

the court heard he had found out about ms higton(ORG) 's developing relationship with mr harnett(PERSON) by hacking into her snapchat account . 

judge mrs(PERSON) justice(PERSON) lambert(PERSON) said there were no mitigating factors . 

" this is a case of such exceptional seriousness that even a very long minimum term would not be a just punishment . what you did that night was horrific , " she told osborne(PERSON) .(PERSON) 

she said the killings were driven by " pathological jealousy " . 

" everything you did was motivated by sex and your need to sexually humiliate and degrade , " the judge added .

osborne(PERSON) also received a 10(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) concurrent sentence for the rape and false imprisonment of the other woman in the house . 

speaking after the sentencing , mr harnett(PERSON) 's family said police are failing to protect the most vulnerable , particularly when it comes to acting on domestic abuse reports . 

his brother , jordan(PERSON) harnett(PERSON) , said : " how does a man with a history of domestic violence walk free from a police station on bail ? 

" police are unable to protect people who need it the most . what are our government doing ? " 

" i want police to take threats to kill more seriously . police need to do more . i 'd like to see the police listen to women like katie(PERSON) . " 

west(GPE) yorkshire(GPE) police said the murders were " truly dreadful " . 

however , it said it was limited in what it could say as an investigation into its handling of the case - in conjunction with police watchdog the independent office for police conduct ( iopc ) - is ongoing .

the informal start to the 2024(DATE) presidential race started deep inside texas(GPE) this(DATE) week(DATE) with the two(CARDINAL) most likely presidential contenders facing off over america(GPE) ’s growing immigration crisis . 

split screens on television channels showed live coverage of president joe(PERSON) biden(PERSON) ’s trip into brownsville(GPE) , overlooking the(LOC) gulf(LOC) of(LOC) mexico(LOC) , as former president donald(PERSON) trump(PERSON) inspected the border at eagle pass , in maverick(GPE) county(GPE) . 

it was only biden(ORG) ’s second(ORDINAL) trip to the border since his presidency began in 2021(DATE) , at which time he tore up a long list of the trump administration ’s hardline immigration policies . 

but now he ’s facing a crisis that has spread across the country , from swing states such as arizona(GPE) to democrat(NORP) strongholds such as new(GPE) york(GPE) . 

more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 9(CARDINAL) million(CARDINAL) illegal immigrants have crossed the border since biden(PERSON) took office , heaping pressure on housing , jobs , hospitals and schools and triggering a spate of 33,000(CARDINAL) migrant crimes in 2023(DATE) according to immigration and customs enforcement . 

“ it ’s time to act . it ’s long past time , ” biden(PERSON) said , before pointing the finger at trump and his republican(NORP) colleagues for refusing to support legislation on the issue . 

trump , who visited the border with texas(GPE) governor greg(PERSON) abbott(PERSON) , responded by saying the president had done nothing for three(DATE) years(DATE) and now refused to mention university(ORG) of(ORG) georgia(ORG) student laken(PERSON) riley(PERSON) who was allegedly murdered by a man who entered the us(GPE) illegally in 2022(DATE) . 

“ joe(PERSON) biden(PERSON) will never say laken(PERSON) riley(PERSON) ’s(PERSON) name , but we will say it and we will remember her . i spoke to her parents last(TIME) night(TIME) . we are not going to forget her , ” trump(PERSON) said . 

the former president , who is leading biden by two(CARDINAL) points in national polls , claimed that the number of illegal immigrants that could cross the us(GPE) border might hit 18(CARDINAL) million(CARDINAL) under biden(PERSON) . 

what the polls say 

a gallup(ORG) poll this(DATE) week(DATE) showed that immigration is now the most important problem in the us(GPE) by a plurality of 28(MONEY) per(MONEY) cent(MONEY) , while at the same time , biden(PERSON) ’s trustworthiness on the issue has plummeted . 

in 2020(DATE) , trump was more trusted on immigration by 16(CARDINAL) percentage points , according to an nbc(ORG) news(ORG) polling . that margin more than doubled to 35(CARDINAL) percentage points by january(DATE) . 

more importantly for this year(DATE) ’s election , polling from morning(TIME) consult and bloomberg(PERSON) found that among swing state voters , such as those in the border state of arizona(GPE) , trump(GPE) is more trusted to handle the issue of immigration over biden by 22(CARDINAL) points . 

biden(PERSON) knows the politics of this means he has to steer another course on immigration policies , especially following democrat(NORP) tom(PERSON) suozzi(PERSON) ’s(PERSON) congressional win this(DATE) month(DATE) after his campaign focused on the need to tighten immigration laws . new(GPE) york(GPE) alone is spending $(MONEY) us12(MONEY) billion(MONEY) on the 100,000(CARDINAL) illegal immigrants it has received . 

a fund - raising arm – the house majority pac – spent around(MONEY) $(MONEY) us7(MONEY) million(MONEY) to support suozzi ’s bid , while saying the democrats(NORP) had to go on the offence when it comes to “ immigration ” . 

a democrat(NORP) congressman in new(GPE) york(GPE) ’s(GPE) adjoining wealthy state of connecticut(GPE) , chris(PERSON) murphy(PERSON) , told his democratic(NORP) colleagues , “ we risk losing the 2024(DATE) election if we do not seize this opportunity to go on the offence on the issue of the border ” . 

more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 70(CARDINAL) per cent of surveyed democrats(NORP) rate the government ’s handling of the influx of migrants at the us - mexico border as “ somewhat bad ” or “ very bad ” , according to the pew research centre . 

part of the issue for biden(PERSON) is his demolition of trump(PERSON) ’s tough immigration policies . biden(PERSON) ’s cabinet secretary alejandro(PERSON) mayorkas(PERSON) , whom the(ORG) us(ORG) house(ORG) of(ORG) representatives(ORG) voted to impeach this(DATE) month(DATE) , is now haunted by his quote in 2021(DATE) that , “ we have rescinded so many trump immigration policies , it would take so much time to list them ” . 

apart from biden(ORG) ’s more conciliatory stance to illegal immigrants seeking to live in america(GPE) , he stopped the construction of the border wall system and terminated the migrant protection protocols that sent tens(CARDINAL) of(CARDINAL) thousands(CARDINAL) of alleged asylum seekers to wait in mexico(GPE) – known as the so - called remain in mexico(GPE) policy . 

the director of policy studies at the centre for immigration studies , jessica(PERSON) vaughan(PERSON) , notes biden(PERSON) cancelled a raft of major trump - era policies . 

“ he cancelled agreements with transit nations to offer safe haven to migrants and enforce their borders ; he relaxed application of title 42(CARDINAL) pandemic controls so that minors and families could enter ; he began awarding immigration parole to tens(CARDINAL) of(CARDINAL) thousands(CARDINAL) of illegal crossers , in defiance of the intent of congress(ORG) ; he extended temporary protected status ( tps ) to citizens of more nations and more recent arrivals ; he established strict limitations on interior enforcement to suppress deportations of all but the most egregious criminals ; and launched plans for a new asylum system designed to expedite the legalisation of illegal border crossers , ” she says . 

executive action 

reversing these policies does not require congressional legislative approval despite much being made about debate in congress(ORG) on new legislation . biden(PERSON) knows this and is quietly changing his tune . 

he told us governors this(DATE) week(DATE) that he was working with white(ORG) house(ORG) attorneys on executive actions to limit crossings at the southern border . foremost among the proposals under consideration is a plan to prohibit asylum claims after a certain number of border crossings is reached , allowing the administration to quickly remove individuals without an asylum hearing . 

but analysts at independent political advisory group beacon research say that is not going to be enough to ease the crisis . 

“ any executive action is unlikely to dramatically reduce asylum claims before the election . while taking executive action on immigration could benefit biden , we believe it is unlikely to significantly shift voters ’ opinions of his handling of the issue . ” 

biden(PERSON) is trying to shift the blame onto failed legislation . in may(DATE) last(DATE) year(DATE) , the republican(NORP) - controlled house passed the secure the border act , which reinstated many trump - era policies . democrats(NORP) voted against it and a watered - down bipartisan bill was only recently reintroduced in the senate(ORG) , which a handful of democrats(NORP) voted against and a handful of republicans(NORP) voted in favour . 

“ i did n’t get everything i wanted in that compromise bipartisan bill but neither did anybody else . compromise as part of the process . that ’s how democracy works , ” biden(PERSON) said while addressing homeland security employees in brownsville(GPE) . 

“ those senators who oppose it need to set aside politics and pass it on merits not on whether it ’s going to benefit one(CARDINAL) party or benefit the other party , ” biden(PERSON) added . 

political advertisers from both parties have already spent $(MONEY) us52(MONEY) million(MONEY) on campaign ads about immigration so far this(DATE) year(DATE) . 

it is by far the top issue in terms of political advertising spend , almost(MONEY) $(MONEY) 20(MONEY) million(MONEY) ahead of any other issue according to adimpact data , meaning immigration is looking more like the adjudicator of who takes the(ORG) white(ORG) house(ORG) on november(DATE) 5(DATE) .

russia(GPE) jails jehovah(PERSON) ’s witness for 8(DATE) years(DATE) after ‘ mole ’ secretly films worship meeting 

( reuters(ORG) ) – a court in southwestern russia(GPE) has sentenced a jehovah ’s witness to eight(DATE) years(DATE) in prison after finding him guilty of organising “ extremist activities ” , according to a spokesman for the group . 

russia(GPE) ’s supreme(ORG) court(ORG) designated the christian(NORP) denomination as “ extremist ” in 2017(DATE) , liquidating and banning its nearly(CARDINAL) 400(CARDINAL) chapters across the country . 

russia(GPE) counted roughly(CARDINAL) 175,000(CARDINAL) active believers at the time of the ban , according to the group ’s russian(NORP) website . since then , raids , interrogations and jailings of adherents have occurred with some regularity . 

the case against aleksandr(PERSON) chagan(PERSON) , 52(DATE) , was built around a “ mole ” who secretly filmed worship meetings held by videoconference , said the spokesman , jarrod(NORP) lopes . 

sentenced by a court in tolyatti on thursday(DATE) , chagan(PERSON) is the sixth(ORDINAL) witness to receive eight(DATE) years(DATE) , the longest term imposed since the ban , lopes said . 

religious life in russia(GPE) is dominated by the russian(NORP) orthodox church , which is championed by and loyal to president vladimir(PERSON) putin(PERSON) . some orthodox scholars view jehovah(PERSON) ’s witnesses , known for door - to - door preaching and refusing military service , as a “ totalitarian sect ” . 

at(CARDINAL) least(CARDINAL) 794(CARDINAL) witnesses have been criminally charged in russia(GPE) for their faith , and 127(CARDINAL) are currently serving prison sentences , lopes said . 

last(DATE) month(DATE) , four(CARDINAL) witnesses in the same russian(NORP) region were handed seven(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) jail terms in samara(PERSON) , the same region as chagan(PERSON) , while a female believer was sentenced in tolyatti to two(DATE) years(DATE) ’(DATE) forced labour . 

the(ORG) european(ORG) court(ORG) of human rights , the court of the(ORG) council(ORG) of(ORG) europe(ORG) , ruled in june(DATE) 2022(DATE) that the ban was illegal , three(DATE) months(DATE) after the council expelled russia(GPE) over its full - scale invasion of ukraine(GPE) .(GPE)

x - twitter - has - quietly - restored - a - ban - on - misgendering - and - deadnaming - trans - people : 

x / twitter has ‘ quietly restored ’ a ban on misgendering and deadnaming trans people 

ten(DATE) months(DATE) ago(DATE) , in april(DATE) 2023(DATE) , elon musk ’s x platform – formerly twitter – rolled back a vital policy protecting transgender users from misgendering and deadnaming in a move that was widely condemned . 

the move meant that x immediately fell behind other social media companies including tiktok and pinterest , which have both explicitly banned misgendering , deadnaming , misogyny and the promotion of ‘ conversion therapy ’ practices . 

this unpopular decision seemed to come about decision came after elon musk suggested that his own tweets might violate the 2018(DATE) policy , so the rule was quietly dropped . now , it seems that x just as quietly reinstated the original policy – back in january(DATE) 2024(DATE) . 

ars technica reports that , in a section labeled “ use of prior names and pronouns , ” x ’s updated policy confirms that x will “ reduce the visibility of posts that purposefully use different pronouns to address someone other than what that person uses for themselves , or that use a previous name that someone no longer goes by as part of their transition . ” 

lgbtq+ journalist ari(PERSON) drennen(PERSON) picked up the report , tweeting it to her followers and writing , “ do n’t look now but x ( formerly twitter ) quietly restored their ban on misgendering and deadnaming trans people – as long as it ’s reported by the target . ” 

the policy reinstatement comes in the wake of multiple high - profile lgbtq+ organisations and individuals quitting x , citing a rise in anti - lgbtq+ and anti(NORP) -(NORP) trans(NORP) “ hate and vitriol ” on the platform .

x users responded to news of the change , with one(CARDINAL) person tweeting , “ had to go look for myself . it says january(DATE) 2024(DATE) . so very quietly putting it back . i just got a violation for using the word cis . unbelievable . ” 

another person added , “ someone either read enough to widen their perspective or the company was going to get hit with litigation . we will never know unfortunately . ” 

whether this change will have any impact on the overall safety of lgbtq+ people using the platform remains to be seen – it ’s also not clear whether any lgbtq+ organisations who have quit the platform will return . 

non - profit lgbtq+ suicide prevention organisation the trevor(PERSON) project announced its official departure from x in november(DATE) 2023(DATE) , saying , “ lgbtq+ young people are regularly victimised at the expense of their mental health and x ’s removal of certain moderation functions makes it more difficult for us to create a welcoming space for them on this platform . ” 

transgender charity mermaids made a similar announcement in october(DATE) 2023(DATE) – as did lgbtq(PERSON) youth scotland(GPE) and the(ORG) san(ORG) francisco(ORG) lgbt(ORG) centre(ORG) in may(DATE) 2023(DATE) .

article - boeing - reportedly - in - talks - to - buy-737 - fuselage - maker - spirit : 

boeing(ORG) ba(ORG) -(ORG) n(ORG) is in talks to buy its former subsidiary spirit aerosystems spr - n and the planemaker is also delaying plans to ramp up 737(PRODUCT) jetliner production as it tries to get control of a sprawling crisis sparked by a mid - air panel blowout . 

for weeks(DATE) , boeing(ORG) has been reeling from the fallout of the 737(PRODUCT) max incident when a door plug blew off at 16,000(QUANTITY) feet(QUANTITY) ( 4,877(QUANTITY) meters(QUANTITY) ) above the ground on jan(DATE) .(DATE) 5(DATE) . u.s(GPE) .(GPE) aviation regulators have already curbed production and air carriers have been in discussion for more aircraft deliveries with its bigger rival , airbus(ORG) . 

“ we believe that the reintegration of boeing(ORG) and spirit aerosystems ’ manufacturing operations would further strengthen aviation safety , improve quality and serve the interests of our customers , employees , and shareholders , ” boeing(ORG) said in a statement on friday(DATE) . spirit(ORG) aerosystems(ORG) confirmed the discussions . 

in a related development on friday(DATE) , reuters(ORG) was the first(ORDINAL) to report the company told suppliers it was delaying expected increases in plane production as it tries to regain the confidence of the industry and satisfy regulators ’ desires for better oversight of its safety and quality control systems . 

reuters(ORG) reported last(DATE) month(DATE) that years of decentralization of boeing(ORG) ’s planemaking capacity – along with an exodus of experienced workers and aggressive cost - cutting – has affected quality . two(CARDINAL) crashes a(DATE) few(DATE) years(DATE) ago(DATE) dented the confidence of both the public and regulators in boeing(ORG) ’s safety record . 

the first(ORDINAL) crash , of a lion air flight in indonesia(GPE) , occurred in october(DATE) 2018(DATE) and killed all 189(CARDINAL) people aboard . the second(ORDINAL) crash of an ethiopian(NORP) airlines flight in march(DATE) 2019(DATE) killed 157(CARDINAL) people . 

boeing(ORG) spun off spirit in 2005(DATE) and in recent(DATE) years(DATE) has struggled with cost pressures and problems that have slowed aircraft deliveries and thinned its balance sheet . bringing spirit back into the fold could address some of those quality issues as it would give boeing(ORG) more control over manufacturing . 

the preliminary talks were reported earlier on friday(DATE) by the(ORG) wall(ORG) street(ORG) journal(ORG) , which also said that spirit has hired bankers . 

such a move could also help boeing(ORG) lower spirit ’s production costs , a senior industry source told reuters(ORG) . boeing(ORG) had previously considered repurchasing spirit aerosystems , but the optics of buying back at a higher price discouraged such a move , the source said . 

however , spirit ’s shares have fallen 70(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) over the(DATE) last(DATE) five(DATE) years(DATE) , and its $(MONEY) 3.3(MONEY) billion(MONEY) market value is far short of boeing(ORG) ’s $(MONEY) 124(MONEY) billion(MONEY) . “ boeing(ORG) probably realizes that divesting its wichita operations that make up the core of spirit aerosystems was a strategic mistake , ” scott(PERSON) mikus(PERSON) , equity research associate at melius(ORG) research(ORG) said . shares of spirit aerosystems closed up 15(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) on friday(DATE) in regular trading and were up 2.3(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) after hours(TIME) . boeing(ORG) closed down 1.8(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) and were flat post market . 

the u.s(GPE) .(GPE) federal aviation administration in late(DATE) january(DATE) barred boeing(ORG) from increasing production of the 737(PRODUCT) max as it presses for changes . 

on feb(DATE) .(DATE) 12(DATE) , faa(ORG) head mike(PERSON) whitaker(PERSON) visited boeing(ORG) ’s renton(GPE) , washington(GPE) , factory , where the 737(PRODUCT) max line is produced , and expressed concerns about some things he saw on the tour to ceo dave(PERSON) calhoun(PERSON) earlier(DATE) this(DATE) week(DATE) , two(CARDINAL) people briefed on the matter told reuters(ORG) . 

according to boeing(ORG) ’s latest 737(PRODUCT) supplier master schedule seen by reuters(ORG) , the company had to delay plans to increase production from 38(CARDINAL) to 42(CARDINAL) aircraft per month to june , from the initial target date of february(DATE) . boeing(ORG) has also pushed back subsequent production increases throughout 2024(DATE) and 2025(DATE) . 

spirit , one(CARDINAL) of the industry ’s major manufacturers of large aircraft structures , has struggled with cash flow problems over the(DATE) past(DATE) few(DATE) quarters(DATE) and quality issues surrounding the fuselages it makes for boeing(ORG) ’s 737(PRODUCT) narrowbody jets . 

the company is also exploring selling operations in ireland(GPE) that makes wings for the airbus(ORG) a220(PRODUCT) jet(PRODUCT) , as it would be unusual for boeing(ORG) to supply its competitor . 

“ for boeing(ORG) , this does give them the opportunity to bring spirit in - house and fix its problems , but boeing(ORG) of course has its own issues and has hardly covered itself with glory when it comes to execution of late , ” said vertical research partners analyst robert(PERSON) stallard(PERSON) . 

investigators are still trying to definitively sort out responsibility for the jan(DATE) .(DATE) 5(DATE) incident . spirit made the panel , but boeing(ORG) removed it to fix rivet damage and then put it back , according to a preliminary report by u.s(GPE) .(GPE) investigators who found pictures showing the panel at boeing(ORG) apparently missing key bolts .

published on : march(DATE) 2(DATE) ,(DATE) 2024 04:25(TIME) pm(TIME) npt(PERSON) by : republica(PERSON) | @republicanepal 

kathmandu(GPE) , march(DATE) 2(DATE) : nepal has been ranked 150th(ORDINAL) out of 193(CARDINAL) countries in the government ai readiness index , 2023(DATE) . 

the report published by the oxford(ORG) insights shows the us in first(ORDINAL) position with 84.80(CARDINAL) total score , while singapore(GPE) the second(ORDINAL) in the index with 81.97(CARDINAL) total score . 

nepal(PERSON) has got the total score- 30.77(CARDINAL) . 

in the index , the total score is calculated from three(CARDINAL) bases- government pillar , technology sector pillar , and data and infrastructure pillar . 

with total score , 30.77(CARDINAL) , nepal(PERSON) has achieved 31.04(CARDINAL) in government pillar , 24.21(CARDINAL) in technology sector pillar , and 37.06(CARDINAL) in data and infrastructure pillar . 

in the(DATE) previous(DATE) year(DATE) , 2022(DATE) , nepal(PERSON) had secured 139th(ORG) position out of 181(CARDINAL) countries in the government ai readiness index . the total score was 30.75(CARDINAL) where nepal(GPE) got 30.88(CARDINAL) mark under government pillar , 23.50(CARDINAL) mark under technology sector pillar , and 37.88(CARDINAL) mark under the data and infrastructure pillar . 

afghanistan(GPE) has been ranked at the bottom ( 181st(NORP) rank ) with a 13.46(CARDINAL) total score in 2022(DATE) , while the(GPE) democratic(GPE) republic(GPE) of(GPE) korea(GPE) is at the bottom ( 193rd ) with a total score 9.20(CARDINAL) in 2023(DATE) . 

india(GPE) is ranked 40th(ORDINAL) while china(GPE) 16th(ORDINAL) in 2023(DATE) , while they were ranked 32nd(ORDINAL) and 17th(ORDINAL) respectively in 2022(DATE) . 

the three(CARDINAL) pillars were analyzed by setting different dimensions . under the government pillar , there were four(CARDINAL) dimensions- vision , governance and ethic , digital capacity , and adaptability . similarly , the technology sector pillar comprised three(CARDINAL) dimensions- maturity , innovation capacity , and human capital . the third(ORDINAL) pillar , data and infrastructure , has also included three(CARDINAL) dimensions , infrastructure , data availability and data representativeness . 

a total of 39(CARDINAL) indicators were set for 10(QUANTITY) dimensions(QUANTITY) under(QUANTITY) three(QUANTITY) pillars . 

the report collected data from various sources , including oecd(ORG) ai policy observatory , un(PERSON) idir(PERSON) ai(PERSON) policy portal , global cybersecurity index , worldwide governance indicators , un(ORG) e - government survey , network readiness index , international(ORG) telecommunications(ORG) union(ORG) , and the(ORG) world(ORG) bank(ORG) . 

the index has mentioned the developments relating to ai in all sorts of countries ranging from ldcs(GPE) to emerging economies to the developed ones . 

persisting global digital divide 

in the finding , the report stated , " half(CARDINAL) of the ai strategies that were published or announced come from low and lower middle - income countries . the scores in the data and infrastructure pillar show a substantial difference between high- and low - income economies , illustrating an existing global digital divide . " 

at a time when most of the countries are swayed by the modern buzz , ai , and striving to both promote and regulate ai irrespective of their capacities , the index is expected to cater relevant knowledge to the government , private sectors and researchers .

agalega(PERSON) - in - the - shifting - geopolitical - landscape : 

agalega(PERSON) in the shifting geopolitical landscape 

editorial 

for several(DATE) years(DATE) , the spectre of a clandestine mauritius(GPE) - india agreement to establish an indian(NORP) military base on agalega(PERSON) has loomed over parliamentary debates and local media headlines . the mere mention of a military base on this idyllic island in the indian(NORP) ocean has stirred controversy and raised concerns about sovereignty . yet , amidst the speculation and allegations , the mauritius government has consistently maintained a stance of denial , refuting the existence of any such agreement with the indian(NORP) authorities . 

as early as may 2017(DATE) , an official communique following prime minister pravind(PERSON) jugnauth(PERSON) ’s state visit to india(GPE) outlined plans for agalega(PERSON) ’s economic development . in this statement , it was revealed that basic infrastructure , including a runway and jetty , would be constructed by the(ORG) government(ORG) of(ORG) india(ORG) at its own expense . an agreement to this effect was signed during the prime minister ’s state visit , signalling india(GPE) ’s commitment to supporting mauritius in enhancing the economic potential of agalega(PERSON) . however , the authorities and the pmo steadfastly refused at making the mou(ORG) public or laying it in the national assembly , claiming a confidentiality clause , although india(GPE) was reported not to have any qualms on its public release . 

despite the pm ’s assurances therefore and the unexplained need for confidentiality , questions persisted , prompting further inquiries from both the public and political figures . notably , hon xavier duval raised concerns in may(DATE) 2021(DATE) , seeking clarity on the nature of the infrastructure projects and their implications for agalega(PERSON) ’s future . in response , the prime minister reiterated the collaborative nature of the projects , emphasizing that they aimed to bolster economic development rather than establish a military base . mention was made of mauritius(GPE) partnering india(GPE) in the latter ’s sagar project for regional development and security challenges in the north indian ocean . it was also categorically stated that there would be no stockpile of weapons on agalega(PERSON) , distinguishing it from conventional military bases established by other nations in the region . 

the most recent affirmation of mauritius(GPE) ’ sovereignty over agalega(PERSON) came from prime minister jugnauth(PERSON) during the inauguration of the newly constructed facilities on february(DATE) 29(DATE) . these projects , including a jetty and a three(QUANTITY) -(QUANTITY) kilometre(QUANTITY) - long runway , were fully financed and built by the indian(NORP) authorities . the prime minister reassured the public that mauritius(GPE) would retain control over these facilities , dispelling concerns about jeopardizing the island ’s sovereignty . 

while official statements seek to allay fears , there has been and remains a palpable need for greater openness from mauritian(GPE) and indian(NORP) authorities regarding the details of the bilateral agreement . the lack of transparency has fuelled speculation , some unhealthy or unproductive , in some(DATE) quarters(DATE) . clarity on the terms and conditions governing india(GPE) ’s generous contribution to the development of agalega(PERSON) ’s infrastructure is essential . 

on the other hand , amidst this controversy , it is crucial to analyze the shifting geopolitical dynamics in the indian(NORP) ocean region . the emergence of new players with diverse strategic interests , coupled with security challenges such as piracy and geopolitical tensions , underscores the importance of safeguarding mauritius ’ security and economic interests . as a small island state , mauritius(GPE) must navigate these complexities with foresight and strategic acumen . unfortunately , it has not developed a mature approach where political divides can be bridged for matters of national interest or where leaders of opposition parties can be taken in the confidence of what ’s brewing . 

in conclusion , while the agalega(PERSON) controversy continues to spark debate and speculation , it is imperative to separate fact from fiction and embrace geopolitical realities . transparent communication from the authorities , coupled with a nuanced understanding of regional geopolitics , is essential for safeguarding mauritius(GPE) ’ sovereignty and security in an ever - evolving geopolitical landscape . as mauritius(ORG) charts its course in the indian(NORP) ocean , strategic alignment with regional dynamics that serve the nation ’s interests remains paramount . by strategizing intelligently and embracing transparency , mauritius(GPE) can advance its long - term political and economic interests amidst the complexities of the indian(NORP) ocean region .

supreme - court - police - ip - warrant - canada : 

the(ORG) supreme(ORG) court(ORG) of(ORG) canada(ORG) ruled friday(DATE) that police must obtain a warrant before requesting a canadians(NORP) ’ internet protocol address in a significant victory for privacy advocates . 

in a 5(CARDINAL) - 4 ruling , the(ORG) supreme(ORG) court(ORG) asserted that canadians(NORP) have charter - protected privacy rights when it comes to cops requesting information about their online activities . 

“ personal privacy is vital to individual dignity , autonomy , and personal growth . its protection is a basic prerequisite to the flourishing of a free and healthy democracy , ” the majority ruling read . 

“ the internet requires that users reveal subscriber information to their isp to participate in this new public square , and canadians(NORP) are not required to become digital recluses in order to maintain some semblance of privacy in their lives . ” 

at issue was a 2017(DATE) investigation by the(ORG) calgary(ORG) police(ORG) into fraudulent online purchases from a liquor store . 

police went to the liquor store ’s payment processing company , moneris(PERSON) , and requested internet protocol ( ip ) addresses related to the purchases . they did not get a warrant . 

moneris(PERSON) handed over two(CARDINAL) ip addresses used for the transactions , which the police used to obtain a court order requiring an internet service provider to turn over the names and addresses associated with the ip addresses . 

that led to a search of andrei(ORG) bykovets(ORG) ’(ORG) residence(ORG) , and to bykovet(PERSON) ’s arrest on charges of possessing other peoples ’ credit cards and identification documents . bykovet(PERSON) challenged the cops ’ right to obtain his ip address from moneris(PERSON) , arguing it violated his charter rights against unreasonable search and seizure . 

both the trial judge and the(ORG) alberta(ORG) court(ORG) of appeal ruled that canadians(NORP) had no reasonable expectation of privacy for their ip address . the(ORG) supreme(ORG) court(ORG) disagreed . 

“ activity associated with the ip addresses can be correlated with other online activity associated with that address available to the state . an ip address can also set the state on a trail of internet activity that leads directly to a user ’s identity , ” the decision read . 

“ access to ip addresses without judicial pre - authorization poses intense privacy risks . ” 

police agencies used to routinely request what they called “ basic subscriber information ” from telecommunications companies – information such as names , ip addresses , physical addresses and telephone numbers . 

but the supreme(ORG) court(ORG) ruling does not stop police from accessing ip addresses – just requires them to get a court order first(ORDINAL) , a process that law enforcement agencies have said takes time particularly for urgent cases . 

the(ORG) bc(ORG) civil(ORG) liberties(ORG) association(ORG) , which intervened in the case , welcomed the court ’s majority decision friday(DATE) and said it was “ heartened ” by the court ’s recognition that privacy has become “ ever more important ” in the digital age . 

“ the reality today(DATE) is that in order to engage in society to any degree , we really have to be able to go online . and so if the police have easy access to all of our online activity , which website we ’re going to , who we ’re talking to online , that creates a huge chilling effect on people ’s behaviour , ” vibert(PERSON) jack(PERSON) , the bccla(GPE) ’s director of litigation , told global in an interview . 

“ privacy rights are obviously implicated , but our freedom of expression , freedom of association , those rights would all be curtailed if we know the police could be watching us while we ’re online . ” 

while the(ORG) supreme(ORG) court(ORG) decision notes that the determining a reasonable expectation of privacy under the charter is an “ exercise in balance , ” it also noted that the internet has vastly expanded the amount of personal information 

“ the intensely private nature of the information an ip address may betray strongly suggests that the public ’s interest in being left alone should prevail over the government ’s interest in advancing its law enforcement goals , ” the decision read .

us asylum measure aimed at curbing claims has limited impact given strained border budget 

tucson(GPE) , ariz . ( ap ) — inside giant white tents that house about(CARDINAL) 1,000(CARDINAL) migrants near tucson(FAC) international(FAC) airport(FAC) , border patrol agents demonstrate clockwork efficiency to release detainees within two(DATE) days(DATE) of arrest with orders to appear in immigration courts at their final destinations . agents transmit information from the field to colleagues who prepare court papers while migrants are bused hours(TIME) away to a processing center , minimizing time in custody . 

notably missing from the operations hub in the busiest corridor for illegal crossings into the u.s(GPE) .(GPE) are asylum officers who do initial screenings , which are intended to weed out weak claims that do n't meet narrowly prescribed grounds for seeking protection , such as race , religion and political opinion . 

asylum officers were instructed nearly(DATE) a(DATE) year(DATE) ago(DATE) to apply a higher screening standard on those who cross the border illegally after passing though another country , such as mexico(GPE) , but they are too understaffed to have much impact . the biden administration hails the higher standard as a cornerstone of its border policy in legal challenges , but its application in only a small percentage of arrests shows how budgets can fail to match ambitions . 

strained budgets continue to loom large as the(ORG) white(ORG) house(ORG) again considers sweeping measures to limit asylum at the border . 

the failure of a $(MONEY) 20(MONEY) billion(MONEY) spending plan on border security this(DATE) month(DATE) has caused the administration to assess its priorities . u.s(GPE) .(GPE) immigration and customs enforcement , facing a $(MONEY) 700(MONEY) million(MONEY) hole this(DATE) year(DATE) , is considering cutting the number of detention beds from 38,000(CARDINAL) to 22,000(CARDINAL) and facilitating fewer deportation flights . these possible steps were first(ORDINAL) reported by the washington(GPE) post and confirmed to the associated press by a u.s(GPE) .(GPE) official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly . 

the failed spending package crafted by senate(ORG) negotiators would have given $(MONEY) 4(MONEY) billion(MONEY) to u.s(GPE) .(GPE) citizenship and immigration services , including to add 4,338(CARDINAL) asylum officers to screen applicants and make final decisions on claims — more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) four(CARDINAL) times current staffing . 

arrests for illegal border crossings from mexico(GPE) plunged to the second(ORDINAL) - lowest monthly(DATE) rate of joe(PERSON) biden(PERSON) 's(PERSON) presidency , a(DATE) month(DATE) after the higher standard replaced covid-19 pandemic - related asylum restrictions . the rule “ is working as intended and has already significantly reduced encounters at the border , ” blas(PERSON) nuñez - neto , assistant homeland security secretary for border and immigration policy , said in a court filing at the time . 

asylum - seekers subject to tougher screenings had a 59(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) pass rate through september(DATE) , down from 85(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) in the(DATE) five(DATE) years(DATE) before the pandemic , nuñez - neto said in another court filing . 

while that suggests the policy has made a difference , its scope has been limited . officers interviewed only(CARDINAL) 57,700(CARDINAL) migrants under the new rule through september(DATE) , according to nuñez - neto . that represents only(PERCENT) about(PERCENT) 15(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) of the nearly(CARDINAL) 365,500(CARDINAL) migrants released by border patrol from june(DATE) to(DATE) september(DATE) with notices to appear in immigration court . 

the(ORG) department(ORG) of(ORG) homeland(ORG) security(ORG) declined to provide more recent numbers . it insists the higher screening standard is working as intended , while acknowledging it has failed to keep pace with unprecedented migration flows and calling on congress(ORG) to adequately fund the efforts . 

asylum officers did more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 130,000(CARDINAL) screenings , known as “ credible fear interviews , ” at the border during the 2023(DATE) budget(DATE) year(DATE) , which was more than double the(DATE) year(DATE) before(DATE) . but more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 600,000(CARDINAL) migrants were released with notices to appear in immigration court in that time and another 300,000(CARDINAL) with orders to report to an immigration office for a court date , a practice that has largely ceased . 

the border patrol released mbala(PERSON) giodi(PERSON) , 42(DATE) , after holding him for two(DATE) days(DATE) when he crossed the border in remote mountains east of san(GPE) diego(GPE) . he was dropped off at a transit center and told he would have a chance to explain his case for asylum in court , with an initial hearing scheduled in new(GPE) york(GPE) in may . 

“ there was n’t much problem , ” said giodi(GPE) , 42(DATE) , who calls himself a victim of government repression for being a student protestor in angola(GPE) . 

to put the higher screening standard into effect , citizenship and immigration services added about(CARDINAL) 1,000(CARDINAL) staff to assist an existing 850(CARDINAL) or so asylum officers , training former asylum officers and other employees for short stints , said michael(PERSON) knowles(PERSON) , spokesman for the national citizenship and immigration(ORG) services(ORG) council(ORG) . the union represents workers at the agency , which also oversees work visas , green cards , citizenship applications and asylum claims that originate away from the border . 

assigning so many employees to border cases extended waits for other services , he said . weekend(DATE) overtime was mandatory , as was holiday work . 

“ we ’re so overwhelmed and there ’s so much pressure , ” knowles said . “ part of the border crisis is they did n’t hire enough of us to do the work . ” 

a lack of resources hampered another biden policy that took effect in june(DATE) 2022(DATE) , empowering asylum officers to make final rulings on claims , not just screenings . it aimed to ease the workload of immigration judges , whose backlog of more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 3(CARDINAL) million(CARDINAL) cases has allowed asylum - seekers with weak claims to stay in the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) for years(DATE) — with eligibility for work permits — while their cases wind through the system . 

fewer(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 6,000(CARDINAL) asylum cases had been decided under the 2022(DATE) policy by the(DATE) end(DATE) of(DATE) september(DATE) . 

“ that is a very important program that got very little support , ” knowles said . 

advocates for asylum - seekers have sued over application of the higher screening standard . they argue it unfairly penalizes those who cross the border illegally while a heavily oversubscribed online appointment system , called cbp(ORG) one(ORG) , is virtually the only way to come through an official port of entry . the standard remains in effect while a judge 's ruling declaring the policy illegal is under appeal . 

while migration flows dropped immediately after the higher standard took effect , border steady increased as migrants and smugglers adjusted to realities on the ground , peaking at an all - time high of 250,000(CARDINAL) in december(DATE) . 

melissa(PERSON) crow , director of litigation at the center for gender & refugee studies , which is challenging the higher standard , said asylum - seekers eventually face tougher scrutiny before a judge even if the rule ’s limited use at the border allows them to avoid screening . and , she said , congress(ORG) and the(ORG) white(ORG) house(ORG) may agree in the future to provide more money .

kentucky(GPE) - legislature - school - bus - safety-0cb3c3d82ca7160cdf801b0b961e5dcf : 

kentucky(ORG) house(ORG) passes legislation aimed at curbing unruliness on school buses 

frankfort(ORG) , ky . ( ap(PERSON) ) — the kentucky(GPE) house passed a bill friday(DATE) aimed at curbing unruliness on school buses by requiring student and parental buy - in to transportation policies and setting clear consequences for misbehavior . 

the measure sailed through the house on a 93(CARDINAL) - 1 vote to advance to the senate(ORG) . supporters said the goal is to offer relief to beleaguered bus drivers by setting expectations for students and parents . 

misbehavor(ORG) on school buses was termed a statewide issue , but the house discussion focused on kentucky(GPE) ’s largest school system , in louisville(GPE) . in november(DATE) the district was forced to cancel nearly(CARDINAL) 100(CARDINAL) routes after bus drivers organized a sickout and 143(CARDINAL) called off work , with student behavior cited as among their biggest concerns , the courier journal of louisville(GPE) reported . 

setting accountability is crucial to getting the problem under control , republican(ORG) rep(ORG) . kevin(PERSON) bratcher(PERSON) said . 

“ accountability — what happens when you get so far out of line that you ’re stopping a school bus from operating , ” he said . “ you ’re causing the school bus driver to quit their job . ” 

the bill would require local school boards statewide to adopt a policy outlining what ’s expected of students riding school buses and the consequences for failing to meet those standards . 

“ drivers have a huge responsibility , and we should respect and address concerns thoroughly , ” said republican(ORG) rep(ORG) . emily(PERSON) callaway(PERSON) , the bill ’s lead sponsor . 

in setting guidelines , boards would work off a model policy developed by the(ORG) state(ORG) education(ORG) department(ORG) . 

students and parents would have to sign a document acknowledging the policy each(DATE) school(DATE) year(DATE) , and failure to do so could be grounds for revoking bus - riding privileges . 

each district ’s policy would also establish procedures for investigating complaints and protecting those who bring them from retaliation . severe or repeated misconduct could also lead to a loss of bus - riding privileges . 

“ we must be sure that if a student puts him or herself , other riders or the driver in danger , the driver can act appropriately , swiftly and effectively , ” callaway(ORG) said . “ this policy allows for that discretion . ” 

district policies would provide for expeditious reviews of driver complaints about student misbehavior , and drivers would be allowed to be heard during disciplinary procedures . they must also be notified of the outcome of disciplinary actions . if a driver continues to feel unsafe transporting a student , the driver would be allowed to opt out of transporting that student .

the legislation is house bill 446(CARDINAL) .

uk(GPE) : pro(PERSON) -(PERSON) palestine(PERSON) groups and politicians hit back at rishi(PERSON) sunak(PERSON) 's(PERSON) '(PERSON) extremism ' speech 

pro(PERSON) -(PERSON) palestine(PERSON) groups have hit back at uk(GPE) prime minister rish(PERSON) sunak(PERSON) after he claimed gaza(GPE) demonstrations were indicative of " extremists " undermining british(NORP) democracy . 

in an impromptu speech on downing street on friday(DATE) , sunak said the uk(GPE) 's " streets have been hijacked by small groups " that are threatening to " tear us apart " , calling on the police to adopt a tougher stance toward gaza(GPE) protests . 

" we have seen a shocking increase in extremist disruption and criminality . what started as protests on our streets has descended into intimidation , threats , and planned acts of violence , " he said . 

earlier(DATE) in(DATE) the(DATE) week(DATE) , sunak said that there was a " growing consensus that mob rule is replacing democratic rule " , in reference to the protests in the uk(GPE) . 

he said " this situation has gone on long enough " , in reference to protesters , with a direct message that " threats of violence and intimidation are alien to our way of doing things " .

the speech , which came a surprise to many , was condemned by opposition politicians and campaigners , who said it appeared to threaten restrictions on the right to protest . 

ben(PERSON) jamal(PERSON) , head of the(ORG) palestine(ORG) solidarity(ORG) campaign ( psc ) , said it was ironic that sunak wanted to deal with " extremists " considering the uk government 's support for israel(GPE) in the(GPE) gaza(GPE) war(GPE) , which has so far killed more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 30,000(CARDINAL) palestinians(NORP) . 

" maybe he should start with politicians , political commentators and religious leaders who support a state , on trial for genocide , in its mass slaughter , and deliberate creation of famine , " he said on social media . 

" not those protesting against it . " 

caroline(PERSON) lucas(PERSON) , the uk(GPE) 's sole(ORG) green(ORG) party(ORG) mp , also criticised the speech . 

" the mask has really dropped now , if there were any doubt who the real extremists are , it is sunak 's government - threatening to take visas off protesters and stirring up anti(NORP) -(NORP) muslim(NORP) hate , " she tweeted . 

just(DATE) a(DATE) few(DATE) days(DATE) ago(DATE) , a coalition of groups , which regularly organises protests to demand a ceasefire in gaza(GPE) , told journalists that " divisive rhetoric " by british(PERSON) mps(PERSON) and " selective media coverage " are driving calls to curb protest rights in britain(GPE) . 

pro(PERSON) -(PERSON) palestine(PERSON) organisations have levelled accusations against british(NORP) politicians , claiming they are " creating a smokescreen " to shift focus away from demands for a ceasefire . this comes as pressure mounts on police to limit protests in central london(GPE) . 

protest groups raised concerns over reports by middle(LOC) east(LOC) eye that the community security trust was present in special police operations rooms during protests in london(GPE) calling for a ceasefire in gaza(GPE) . the trust describes itself as a charity that " protects british(NORP) jews(NORP) from antisemitism and related threats " . 

despite the criticism of sunak 's speech on friday(DATE) , however , the leader of the(ORG) labour(ORG) party(ORG) keir(PERSON) starmer(PERSON) said he broadly supported the points made . 

sunak was right to " advocate unity and to condemn the unacceptable and intimidatory behaviour that we have seen recently " said starmer(PERSON) in a statement , adding it was important for the prime minister to " defend our values " . 

in contrast , starmer(PERSON) 's predecessor as party leader , jeremy(PERSON) corbyn(PERSON) , defended the right to protest and warned against sunak 's rhetoric . 

" protesting against the mass slaughter of civilians is not a threat to democracy . the real threat to democracy is a government that crushes our rights and silences our solidarity , " he wrote on social media .

chief-executive-officer-sky-network-203656655.html : 

chief executive officer of sky network television picks up 14(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) more stock 

even if it 's not a huge purchase , we think it was good to see that sophie moloney , the chief executive officer of sky network television limited ( nzse(PERSON) : skt ) recently shelled out nz$85k to buy stock , at nz$2.82 per share . while we 're hesitant to get too excited about a purchase of that size , we do note it increased their holding by a solid 14(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) . 

see our latest analysis for sky network television 

sky network television insider transactions over the(DATE) last(DATE) year(DATE) 

in the(DATE) last(DATE) twelve(DATE) months(DATE) , the biggest single purchase by an insider was when insider philip(PERSON) bowman(PERSON) bought nz$537k worth of shares at a price of nz$2.70 per share . so it 's clear an insider wanted to buy , at around the current price , which is nz$2.77 . of course they may have changed their mind . but this suggests they are optimistic . while we always like to see insider buying , it 's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices , as the opportunity they saw may have passed . the good news for sky network television share holders is that insiders were buying at near the current price . 

while sky network television insiders bought shares during the(DATE) last(DATE) year(DATE) , they did n't sell . the chart below shows insider transactions ( by companies and individuals ) over the(DATE) last(DATE) year(DATE) . by clicking on the graph below , you can see the precise details of each insider transaction ! 

there are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares . you probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying . 

insider ownership of sky network television 

another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own . a high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests . based on our data , sky network television insiders have about(PERCENT) 0.7(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) of the stock , worth approximately nz$2.8 m. we consider this fairly low insider ownership . 

so what does this data suggest about sky network television insiders ? 

the recent insider purchase is heartening . we also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions . while the overall levels of insider ownership are below what we 'd like to see , the history of transactions imply that sky network television insiders are reasonably well aligned , and optimistic for the future . so these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock , but it 's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company . to that end , you should learn about the 2(CARDINAL) warning signs we 've spotted with sky network television ( including 1(CARDINAL) which is a bit concerning ) .

it has been agreed that all regional communications must be unblocked based on the principles of sovereignty , jurisdiction , equality and reciprocity , deputy speaker of the(ORG) armenian(ORG) national(ORG) assembly(ORG) said at a panel discussion on “ peace , development and interdependence in the south caucasus ” held on the sidelines of the antalya diplomacy forum .

fps - approves-2 - new - schools - focused - on - self - directed - learning - mental - health : 

fargo(ORG) public(ORG) schools(ORG) approves 2(CARDINAL) new schools focused on self - directed learning , mental health 

the(ORG) fargo(ORG) school(ORG) board(ORG) approved the schools , which will be established in existing buildings . 

fargo(GPE) — the(ORG) fargo(ORG) school(ORG) board(ORG) has voted to establish two(CARDINAL) new academic models or “ schools ” in the district — one(CARDINAL) prioritizing individualized learning and the other mental health . 

during its tuesday(DATE) ,(DATE) feb(DATE) .(DATE) 27(DATE) meeting , the board unanimously approved a self - directed academy and a mental health therapeutic school at explorer(ORG) academy(ORG) , with both starting this(DATE) fall(DATE) . 

superintendent rupak(PERSON) gandhi(PERSON) said the first(ORDINAL) is an innovative approach to benefit students who may underperform in a traditional setting , while the second(ORDINAL) will prioritize students ' mental health while providing them an education . 

the self - directed academy will initially be for grades six(CARDINAL) through eight , and later k-8(GPE) . 

it will first(ORDINAL) be housed at the fps agassiz building at 1305(DATE) 9th(DATE) ave(DATE) . s.(PERSON) , gandhi(PERSON) said , with hopes that the district ’s current long - range facilities planning will identify a future , permanent site . 

advertisement 

the academy is not a hybrid or virtual model , and students will have to meet the same standards as those in the traditional setting but at their own pace . 

“ all of the instruction in this building is still in person . it 's just not bound by time , ” gandhi(PERSON) said . 

a team of five(CARDINAL) or(CARDINAL) six(CARDINAL) educators , including student teachers , paraprofessionals and certified teachers , will be assigned to between(CARDINAL) 100(CARDINAL) to(CARDINAL) 120(CARDINAL) students . the academy could grow to as(CARDINAL) many(CARDINAL) as(CARDINAL) 400(CARDINAL) students , with staff increasing accordingly , he said . 

students will be transported by shuttle from their home middle school campus to the academy and back at the end of the school day for any activities they ’re involved in , he said . 

though the concept was unanimously approved , board members and fargo(ORG) education(ORG) association(ORG) president grant kraft had plenty of concerns and questions beforehand . 

kraft said educators have asked him how staffing will work , and whether staff transfers will be voluntary or involuntary . 

gandhi(PERSON) said he anticipates some current staff will apply and the district may need to make new hires . 

board member katie(PERSON) christianson(PERSON) expressed concern that enrollment will decline in traditional middle schools if many students move to the academy . 

advertisement 

she wondered whether specialized programs like foreign languages or music could then be affected . 

“ i do n't view this as a threat to our comprehensive schools , ” gandhi(PERSON) said . 

academy to follow arizona(GPE) model 

the school district made its first(ORDINAL) official step toward a self - directed academy when the board gave administration the go - ahead to begin exploring and planning the idea last(DATE) september(DATE) . 

the action also allowed the district to submit an innovation waiver to the(ORG) state(ORG) department(ORG) of(ORG) public(ORG) instruction(ORG) . 

gandhi(PERSON) said he ’s confident the department will grant the waiver , allowing the district to start enrolling students in the academy . 

the academy will follow the next education workforce model developed by arizona(ORG) state(ORG) university(ORG) ’s mary(PERSON) lou(PERSON) fulton(PERSON) teachers college . 

several fps administrators traveled to arizona(GPE) last(DATE) fall(DATE) to learn more about it , and several more will go in a(DATE) few(DATE) weeks(DATE) , gandhi(PERSON) said . 

the academy fits in with one(CARDINAL) of the district ’s strategic initiatives calling for “ continuous improvement ” for students with disparate outcomes . 

advertisement 

in a traditional school model , teachers must embed state standards in a school calendar and follow a pacing schedule of when to introduce new material to students . 

students who are regularly absent or more mobile , transferring in or out of a district , will miss certain instruction . 

when assessed later , they might underperform not because they do n't have the ability to show proficiency but solely because they were n’t there , gandhi(PERSON) said . 

the academy is modeled after a school in wilder , idaho(GPE) that serves primarily migrant communities with high mobility rates . 

“ it 's been wildly successful and it 's been a model that we 've thought would be very successful for some of our students , ” gandhi(PERSON) said . 

mental health prioritized 

at the tuesday(DATE) meeting , the board also unanimously approved establishment of a mental health therapeutic school to be located at explorer(ORG) academy(ORG) , the district ’s k-8(ORG) special(ORG) education(ORG) school(ORG) at 1780(DATE) 17th(DATE) st(DATE) . s.(PERSON) 
(PERSON)
while the primary purpose of explorer(ORG) academy(ORG) wo n’t change , part of the building will be used for the non - public , day treatment center , a board memo said . 

a partnering agency , specializing in therapeutic mental health services , will run the treatment center , with fargo public schools being the exclusive provider of academic instruction . 

advertisement 

as a public entity governed by the(ORG) department(ORG) of(ORG) public(ORG) instruction(ORG) , the district is limited to k-12(ORG) academics(ORG) , gandhi(PERSON) said , and ca n’t bill a family ’s insurance plan for services provided , for example . 

“ we ca n't be a treatment provider because we 're educators and not healthcare providers , so this is an avenue to partner together with a health care provider to bridge that gap , ” he said . 

a non - public school can prioritize therapeutic treatment and schedule academics around that treatment , rather than dictate a majority of time be spent on academics , he added . 

after some board members expressed concerns about the arrangement of operating a non - public school within a public school , gandhi(PERSON) assured them that the dpi presented the idea as a viable option . 

he also said it will be a similar set up to the school district 's agreement with nexus - path 's luther(PERSON) hall(PERSON) , a residential treatment facility for boys and girls ages 10(CARDINAL) -(CARDINAL) 17(CARDINAL) , where fps provides academic instruction . 

the district expects to start hearing proposals from organizations interested in operating the mental health therapeutic school starting march(DATE) 6(DATE) .

we - have - suffered - too - much - friday(DATE) - protests - continue - in - kafr - qaduum : 

1(DATE) march(DATE) 2024(DATE) | international solidarity movement | kafr(PERSON) qaduum(PERSON) 
(PERSON)
it is friday(DATE) , and the call to prayer is heard in the rural village of kafr(GPE) qaduum(GPE) , west of nablus(GPE) in the northern part of the(GPE) west(GPE) bank(GPE) . the streets are quiet , empty except some children playing and a few cars heading early to the masjid . around 11 am , some men and boys gather and drink coffee off the main road next door . younger children play and laugh . the scene appears calm if expectant , with an underlying tension . like every friday , after prayer , villagers march in protest of the closure of their village ’s main road and against the israeli(NORP) occupation . 

protests are a regular part of life in rural villages across palestine(GPE) – some as far back as the second(ORDINAL) intifada . but in most parts of the west(GPE) bank(GPE) unarmed protest marches left off after october(DATE) 7th(DATE) , when soldiers and settlers took advantage of hamas(ORG) ’ attacks to unleash a wave of violence , terrorism , land and resource theft against their palestinian(NORP) neighbors . while before , the military used principally tear gas , sound bombs , and rubber coated steel bullets to disperse protestors , since the 7th(ORDINAL) villagers of kafr(ORG) qaduum(ORG) report encountering exclusively live gunfire . 

israeli(NORP) drone flying over the protestors . @ism 

but protests in kafr(GPE) qaduum(GPE) never stopped . abu(PERSON) masseib(PERSON) , former mayor of the village , proudly states they have marched for the opening of their main road every(DATE) friday(DATE) for 13(DATE) years(DATE) – ever since the israeli(NORP) courts refused to uphold their rights . he reports that while military aggression has made protesting more dangerous , the villagers have persisted , adapting their practices to minimize harm . fewer villagers go out each(DATE) week(DATE) , they move cautiously and report back and withdraw quickly if military movements are observed . in spite of these precautions , masseib(ORG) reports that the military have caused serious injuries . since 2011(DATE) , he states that over(CARDINAL) 100(CARDINAL) villagers have been shot with live ammunition . over(CARDINAL) 150(CARDINAL) were arrested , he says , for weeks(DATE) to as long as a year . while none have died , 2(CARDINAL) children suffered horrifying brain injuries from “ less lethal ” rounds to the head . just(DATE) last(DATE) week(DATE) a youth was shot in the face , but survived when the bullet rebounded into his jaw . many more villagers have lost eyes or suffered serious injuries to legs or stomach . in a group of 14(CARDINAL) palestinian(NORP) youths and adults sitting with us , he says “ 10(CARDINAL) of us have been shot with live [ ammunition ] ” . 

when asked why he thinks the people of kafr(GPE) qaduum(GPE) continue to protest when other villages have paused marches , he says , “ we had this issue before oct(DATE) 7th(DATE) ; we want a free road . we have suffered too much ; we understand the occupation . ” over(PERCENT) 50(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) of the village is in area c – parts of the(GPE) west(GPE) bank(GPE) annexed by israel(GPE) , made available for israeli(NORP) settlement and off limits to palestinians(NORP) . this includes most of the villagers ’ olive trees , their primary agricultural production and of immense symbolic value . “ it hurts all the people of the village , ” abu(ORG) maseib(ORG) says . 

today(DATE) the military presence is mostly hidden . a low flying drone watches overhead , and four(CARDINAL) soldiers ’ helmets and hair peek out over the closest hill . the protest moves conservatively , quietly , without shouted slogans or flung stones . still the palestine red crescent ambulance and media are ready to respond and document military aggression . the protest ends abruptly when report comes of military movements , and we — the only internationals present – are shuttled safely out of town before anything escalates . 

it is hard to guess whether solidarity(ORG) activist presence acts as a deterrent these(DATE) days(DATE) . indeed , organizer murad(PERSON) shtaiwi(PERSON) reports there have n’t been other solidarity(ORG) activists present since october(DATE) 7th(DATE) . villagers worry about exposing outsiders to the level of violence they themselves experience on a weekly(DATE) and sometimes daily(DATE) basis . murad(PERSON) reports that much of the violence occurs during the(DATE) week(DATE) , when soldiers enter the village to damage property , arrest protestors identified in drone photos , or just fire guns indiscriminately . he shares a phone video that clearly shows soldiers firing their weapons at head height and up into residential buildings . these are not shots intended only to frighten or disperse , but to injure and kill . 

before solidarity(ORG) activists are driven away , everyone walks together back to the relative safety of home . murad(PERSON) affirms that this is good timing . “ it is an honor , ” he says , “ for us to have martyrs ; but it is a greater honor to have living children ” .

article-789656 : 

since the israel(GPE) - hamas war broke out , we have witnessed israel(GPE) ’s long arm of counter - terrorism operations ( at least those we read about ) , such as the assassination of a hamas(ORG) leader with a well - placed rocket through a window , and a raid into a palestinian(NORP) hospital . unlike the aerial assassination , the hospital raid required boots in the hallways . 

the bravery of the idf(PRODUCT) , shin bet , and police yamam counter - terrorism squads is unmatched . yet both of these events reminded me in some respects of the death of another terrorist in october(DATE) 1995(DATE) – fathi shikaki , the leader of palestine(ORG) islamic(ORG) jihad(ORG) ( pij(ORG) ) . 

in april(DATE) of(DATE) that(DATE) year(DATE) , my 20(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) -(DATE) old(DATE) daughter , alisa(PERSON) , was riding on a bus near the jewish(NORP) community of kfar(ORG) darom(ORG) in gaza(GPE) . alisa(PERSON) was on what she thought would be a three(DATE) -(DATE) day(DATE) vacation before passover . in a phone call to me while waiting for her bus in jerusalem(GPE) , which would be the first(ORDINAL) leg of her journey , she told me she “ wanted to get a(DATE) few(DATE) days(DATE) in the sun ” before the holiday . it would be the last time we spoke . 

she never completed that bus journey because a van parked alongside the road outside the gates to kfar(ORG) darom(ORG) suddenly sped from the shoulder of the road and struck the bus on its right side . the driver then ignited a massive bomb packed inside the van . 

pij(ORG) took credit for the attack in a series of messages relayed to the media and to a college professor in the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) . ( i would learn later that pij did not act alone ; the bomb was made by hamas(ORG) ’s master bomber , yayha(PERSON) ayyash(PERSON) , “ the engineer , ” who himself would be assassinated in early(DATE) 1996(DATE) . ) 

it was a friday(DATE) afternoon(TIME) in october(DATE) that same year when shikaki stepped out of a hotel on the(LOC) mediterranean(LOC) island(LOC) of malta(GPE) . two(CARDINAL) men on a motorcycle stopped opposite him and shot him at point - blank range . while no one took credit for the attack , it was conveyed to me by a caller that i might take some sense of justice delivered from the death of this man . my understanding was that shikaki ’s death was carried out by israel(GPE) ’s long arm of retribution – think post - munich massacre . and the murder of alisa(PERSON) and seven(CARDINAL) others at kfar(ORG) darom(ORG) was worthy of an effort to track down and eliminate the head of pij(ORG) . 

word of the assassination and its link to alisa(PERSON) ’s murder resulted in my being interviewed by a new(GPE) york(GPE) city(GPE) news station . i must have looked like a deer in the headlights when asked for my feelings about shikaki ’s death ; all i could think of saying was “ i am not going to sit shiva for him . ” 

other terrorists have died at the hands of the idf(PRODUCT) , and i am sure israeli(NORP) agents . blame for the drone attack that killed one(CARDINAL) of hamas(ORG) ’s senior leaders , saleh(PERSON) al(PERSON) -(PERSON) arouri(PERSON) , was quickly placed by hamas(ORG) supporters at israel(GPE) ’s feet . 

the social media response was interesting . a general strike was called in the palestinian(NORP) authority territory in the(GPE) west(GPE) bank(GPE) , his mother was grateful he died as a martyr , his “ hope , ” she said . a video was posted , allegedly showing an idf(NORP) soldier handing out candy , as is frequently done in palestinian(NORP) areas when israelis(NORP) are murdered in terror attacks . 

it ’s the comments from the(ORG) pro(ORG) -(ORG) israel(ORG) side that got me thinking about the issue i raise . from a limited reading of coverage in israeli(NORP) media , i came across these comments : “ whoever did the bombing , may they be more successful bombing the rest of the leadership of iran(GPE) , ” “ it ’s a good day when terrorists die , ” “ what good news . more please . ” “ wonderful news , just delightful – and long overdue . ” and “ mazal(PERSON) tov(PERSON) . ” 

what should we feel when a terrorist dies ? 

so , what are we supposed to feel when someone responsible for the deaths of israeli(NORP) civilians meets his own end ? 

many(DATE) years(DATE) ago(DATE) , i was puzzled by the different hallel we say on the(DATE) first(DATE) day(DATE) of passover ( two(DATE) days(DATE) in the diaspora ) and on hol(PERSON) hamoed – the(DATE) intermediate(DATE) days(DATE) of(DATE) the(DATE) holiday(DATE) . hallel , praises to god , is 18(CARDINAL) paragraphs , but on hol(PERSON) hamoed passover it ’s shortened to 10(CARDINAL) paragraphs . however , on sukkot(GPE) , the full hallel is recited each day of the holiday . i am not the only person who has asked why there is a difference ; the question has been discussed for centuries(DATE) . 

taking a legalistic approach to the differences , on sukkot the number of sacrifices offered in the temple set forth separately in the torah(PERSON) . think of each(DATE) day(DATE) as a separate holiday deserving its own obligation to recite hallel . on passover , however , the torah(PERSON) says about the sacrifices , “ similarly shall you do each day for seven(DATE) days(DATE) . ” in the words of rabbi basil herring , “ it is as if each day of passover is merely an extension of the first(ORDINAL) ” and therefore do not require the recital of the full hallel . 

there is also a spiritual approach . 

the talmud relates the children of israel(GPE) crossing through the sea of reeds and assembling on the other side . moses composed a song ; miriam(PERSON) did , too ; and the children of israel(GPE) were joyful about the drowning of the egyptians(NORP) in the sea . 

in addition , the talmud relates that the heavenly angels also began to sing praises , when a heavenly voice thunders and says , “ stop your celebration , the egyptians(NORP) are my children , too . ” while a full hallel is appropriate on the first(ORDINAL) day(s ) of passover , in commemoration of that voice we diminish our joy of the holiday by saying a shorter version during hol(PERSON) hamoed . 

when the almighty punishes murderers , we can rejoice but not by jumping for joy or extending a mazal(PERSON) tov(PERSON) to the idf(PRODUCT) . instead , we find our thanks in the hallel in both the full of the(DATE) first(DATE) days(DATE) of passover and the half(CARDINAL) of hol(ORG) hamoed and the(DATE) days(DATE) at the(DATE) end(DATE) of(DATE) the(DATE) holiday(DATE) . as despicable and vile that terrorists such as fathi shikaki , yahya ayash , and saleh(PERSON) al(PERSON) -(PERSON) arouri(PERSON) were , we should not celebrate their deaths . heaven does n’t want us to . 

the writer is the president of the religious zionists of america ( rza ) . he is the father of alisa(PERSON) flatow(PERSON) , who was murdered in an iranian(NORP) - sponsored palestinian(NORP) terrorist attack in 1995(DATE) , and author of a father ’s story : my fight for justice against iranian(NORP) terror .

i - wish - i - had - never - come - to - the - uk - palestinian - academic - despairs - of - getting - visas - for - family - stuck - in -(GPE) gaza(GPE) : 

when bassem(PERSON) abudagga(PERSON) heard in 2022(DATE) that he had won a british(NORP) council scholarship to do his phd in britain(GPE) , he was elated . “ i was so proud , ” he recalls . “ it is what every academic in palestine(GPE) hopes for : to gain a qualification from the uk(GPE) . 

“ it felt like a turning point for my career , my future , my family . it would shift my prospects to a completely different place . ” 

full of optimism , abudagga(ORG) , a lecturer in business studies at al(ORG) -(ORG) azhar(ORG) university(ORG) in gaza(GPE) , which has since been destroyed by israeli(NORP) bombardment , arrived in the uk(GPE) that october(DATE) to take up his place at york(GPE) st john university . his scholarship is one(CARDINAL) of many awarded annually(DATE) under a prestigious scheme run by the(ORG) british(ORG) council(ORG) to build the capacity of palestinian(NORP) universities . “ this was a british(NORP) investment in me and in my country , ” he says . 

abudagga(PERSON) ’s only regret was that he would have to live apart for long periods from his wife , marim(PERSON) , and two(CARDINAL) children , karim(PERSON) , now four(CARDINAL) , and talya , nine(CARDINAL) . while the whole family could have applied for visas to accompany abudagga(PERSON) , the(ORG) british(ORG) council(ORG) made clear it could only cover the costs for him alone . it would have been too expensive for them all to leave gaza(GPE) , but it would be for the best in the long run , they believed . 

almost(DATE) a(DATE) year(DATE) and(DATE) a(DATE) half(DATE) later(DATE) , the pride and excitement have long gone , and abudagga(PERSON) is desperate . he wishes he had never come here . “ at the beginning , i was so happy , ” he tells the observer . “ now i am just full of regret , that i am not with my family , when they are in such danger . ” 

his wife and children are trapped in gaza(GPE) , in acute and constant danger , living in increasingly desperate conditions . every(DATE) day(DATE) he calls them on malfunctioning phone lines to hear the latest harrowing news of food and water shortages , illness , bombing and destruction , and the loss of friends . 

if that is not painful enough , abudagga(PERSON) faces another unequal challenge : confronting the same uk(GPE) authorities that were so keen to welcome him here just two(DATE) years(DATE) ago(DATE) , in the hope of persuading them to help him bring his family to safety . 

the authorities have told him repeatedly that before they can get the visa application process off the ground , his wife must have fingerprints taken in gaza(GPE) and fill out the necessary forms . the only trouble is , abudagga(PERSON) says , there are no facilities left to get fingerprinting done in gaza(GPE) – no communication system , no help , no infrastructure . so it is impossible to complete this first(ORDINAL) set of tasks before being able to cross the border to egypt(GPE) to complete the application process . 

as one(CARDINAL) british(NORP) source put it : “ there are uk families and people with uk(GPE) relatives getting out . so it can be done . you have to wonder how much of this is to do with the uk(GPE) not wanting to give visas to palestinians(NORP) . ” 

on the(TIME) morning(TIME) of 7 october(DATE) last(DATE) year(DATE) , marim(PERSON) rang her husband from the family ’s home in abasan(GPE) , near khan(PERSON) younis(PERSON) , and told him of the hamas(ORG) attacks , in which more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 1,300(CARDINAL) israelis(NORP) had been murdered . “ she said ‘ we are now in a conflict zone ’ , ” he recalls . “ i knew from that moment that i had to get my family out and bring them here . the rules are clear that they are eligible to come to the uk(GPE) to be with me . i was very frightened , very afraid . ” 

since then , marim and the two(CARDINAL) children have moved five(CARDINAL) times as the israeli(NORP) assaults have intensified and spread . two(DATE) weeks(DATE) ago(DATE) , karim(PERSON) became ill and it was a desperate struggle to find medicine . 

marim(ORG) , talya and karim are currently living inside the(ORG) european(ORG) hospital(ORG) in khan(GPE) younis(GPE) , near rafah , the town that is under threat of imminent israeli(NORP) attack . “ my son became traumatised and depressed by the sound of the carpet bombing , ” says abudagga(PERSON) . “ i would ring them and i would hear it in the background all the time . the hospital is so big it is the only place where he can not hear the sound of the bombing . ” 

his case has been taken up by labour mps(PERSON) rachael(PERSON) maskell(PERSON) , the member for york(ORG) central(ORG) , and rebecca(PERSON) long(PERSON) bailey(PERSON) , who represents salford(PRODUCT) and eccles , where abudagga(PERSON) lives and lectures part time . 

maskell(ORG) said : “ through the(ORG) british(ORG) council(ORG) , the uk(GPE) government invited mr abudagga(PERSON) to the uk as an academic to study . his family could have resided with him . they now have a duty to support his family to be reunited safely with him . ” 

long bailey said : “ this is an urgent and harrowing situation . the government must establish an emergency family reunion visa scheme for desperate families impacted like this . ” 

a foreign office spokesman said : “ the safety of british(NORP) nationals is our top priority . we have helped more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 300(CARDINAL) british(NORP) nationals and their dependants to leave gaza(GPE) . a small number of eligible persons remain and we are working with israeli(NORP) and egyptian(NORP) authorities to support the rest of those who want to leave . ” 

the(ORG) british(ORG) council(ORG) said it was urgently supporting abudagga(PERSON) ’s case .

... meets state energy commissioners 

amid widespread rationing and dwindling generation , the minister of power , chief adebayo(PERSON) adelabu(PERSON) has said that the federal government is poised to address challenges facing power supply in the country . 

chief adelabu who stated this during a meeting with state commissioners of energy in abuja(ORG) said irregular power supply in the country would end soon . 

his assurance comes at a time when the country 's power generation is at its lowest level following the decision by gas suppliers to limit supply over(MONEY) $(MONEY) 1.2(MONEY) billion(MONEY) debt . 

a statement by the minister 's special adviser , strategic communications and media relations , mr bolaji(PERSON) tunji(PERSON) said the government would collaborate with state governments to improve supply . 

addressing the forum which had 23(CARDINAL) states in attendance , adelabu(ORG) said with the efforts put in place to address the challenges in the sector , nigerians should be patient as irregular power supply would soon be a thing of the past in the country . 

he said : " we are poised to address the root cause of the electricity challenge . we have done enough diagnostics , we know the cause of the problem , we are now in the implementation stage . we have realised that in the past , temporary solutions were applied to the challenges without dealing with the root cause " . 

the minister who used the opportunity to encourage state governments to take advantage of the new electricity act and get involved , added that the electricity act has brought about unity in diversity . 

he enjoined the federal and state governments to seize the opportunity to work together . 

" you can always call on me to intervene , i will stand by you and i know once the states start to perform and take up further responsibilities , it means i have also performed . 

" when each of the states starts getting involved , there would be healthy rivalry akin to what we used to have in the(DATE) days(DATE) of regional government " . 

adelabu(ORG) drew attention to abia state where geometrics power limited has established a 188(QUANTITY) megawatts(QUANTITY) power generating plant supplying and distributing power to between(CARDINAL) seven(CARDINAL) and(CARDINAL) eight(CARDINAL) local government areas in the state . 

" they enjoy 24(TIME) hours(TIME) power supply , this is what we want states to also adopt . it might look difficult , but with tenacity and if we endure , it is achievable " , he said . 

the minister advised the state government to get involved in distribution networks in their states and also bridging the meter gap . 

" you can then discuss with the discos on how to capitalise your investment . state government can get involved in picking the executive management of the discos . you already have about(PERCENT) 40(PERCENT) percent(PERCENT) of the shares of the discos . you need to discuss with the(ORG) ministry(ORG) of(ORG) finance(ORG) incorporated ( mofi ) on the shares . if a state buys about(CARDINAL) 10(CARDINAL) , 000 meters , all that needs to be done is to agree with the discos on capitalising the investment " . 

earlier , chairman of the forum who is also the commissioner of power and energy , cross river state , prince(PERSON) eka(PERSON) williams(PERSON) re(PERSON) -(PERSON) affirmed unflinching support towards the outstanding visions , ideas and the electricity reforms of the federal government . 

he noted that the electricity act has given the states the responsibility of running the affairs of electricity in the state .

24153206.bristol(CARDINAL) - stabbings - this - cannot - go - on - says - mark - shelford : 

in the(DATE) few(DATE) years(DATE) i have been the police and crime commissioner for avon(PERSON) and somerset(GPE) , i have had the heart - breaking duty of responding to several fatal stabbings . 

it is indeed a heart - breaking duty . the three(CARDINAL) fatal stabbings in bristol(ORG) recently have moved me to speak . 

to think about these children with their whole lives ahead of them , who have had their lives taken , the loss to their families , and also the loss to the families of those who commit these crimes — it makes the heart ache . and things do n’t need to be like this . 

unfortunately , this is not isolated to one(DATE) month(DATE) , one(CARDINAL) area , or one(CARDINAL) gang . 

according to the home office , there were nearly(CARDINAL) 49,000(CARDINAL) crimes in england(GPE) and wales(NORP) involving knives or sharp objects during the(DATE) year(DATE) ending(DATE) september(DATE) 2023(DATE) , and data from nhs digital shows there were 3,775(CARDINAL) “ hospital episodes ” recorded in english(NORP) hospitals in 2022/23(CARDINAL) that were due to assault by sharp objects . 

this can not go on . 

i want us to think about how we , collectively , can stop it . how do we reach out early enough to the young people who end up involved in knife crime ? how can we alter the course of their lives ? 

the home office , councils , and charities are trying hard to fix the problem . i know from working with these caring people that their shoulder is to the wheel . time and money invested in creating opportunities provided by dedicated professionals . but it is not enough . we need answers as to why these interventions are n’t reaching those who need them most . 

i believe as a society , we need to make our young more resilient and resistant to gang culture that leads to crime and violence . 

we need to give them tools and education to resist gang involvement . many say this can not be achieved , but i fervently disagree ; it can if we set our minds to the problem , which we must , we can solve it . there is both a moral and a financial imperative to do so . 

a(DATE) few(DATE) years(DATE) ago(DATE) , i worked for an american(NORP) nato commander who had a saying : “ you ca n’t wring your hands and roll up your sleeves at the same time ; you have to choose one(CARDINAL) or the other . ” 

well , i choose to roll up my sleeves , to try , and if we are to succeed , i need your support . 

there are mechanisms in place to help the young , but they all kick in once they have fallen out of full - time education . 

not only are the costs considerable , but for some , i worry it may be too little too late . the young person is left trying to negotiate life with few or no qualifications . 

how easy will it be for them to find apprentices , to find work , to resist the seemingly easy wins they may be offered by criminal activity ? 

there is a massive emotional and psychological cost of criminalization , to the young people themselves and to their communities . but there is also a very real financial cost . the youth violence commission final report in july(DATE) 2020(DATE) stated : “ the costs associated with serious violence between young people are of an entirely different magnitude : £(MONEY) 10(MONEY) billion(MONEY) over the(DATE) coming(DATE) 10(DATE) years(DATE) assuming rates of violence continue at their current levels . ” 

£(MONEY) 10(MONEY) billion(MONEY) pounds(MONEY) in 10(DATE) years(DATE) ! 

what we are currently doing is not working . “ the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results . ” 

i propose that we must be both brave and bold to make the change we and our young people need . we need to help these young people , and we need to help them now . 

we have the tools , the know - how , the capability , and the money ; what we need is to collectively demonstrate that we also have the gumption — that magic fusion of competence , confidence , resilience , and enthusiasm . the money really is already there ; we simply need to reapportion it . 

what am i talking about ? i am talking about making youth service a compulsory part of the curriculum . i do n’t mean the reintroduction of national service , but i am talking about the duke of edinburgh(PERSON) award scheme , the cadets , and the scouting and guiding movement . 

all of these organisations lead to positive outcomes for our young people through their focus on physical activity , skill acquisition , and community service . these elements generate a sense of accomplishment and self - worth which in turn contribute to improved physical and emotional well - being , resilience , and a sense of belonging within society . 

personally , i joined the scouts followed by the cadets , and i loved my time in both , but do n’t take my word for it . recently , the northampton(ORG) cadets commissioned a study on the benefits of joining a cadet force entitled “ what is the social impact and return on investment resulting from expenditure in cadet forces in the uk(GPE) ? ” . 

it provides compelling evidence : “ the implications of this finding are important for policymakers . given that higher levels of self - efficacy are correlated with being more resilient , doing better at school , and getting a job , it is very possible that being a cadet is , for a young person from an economically disadvantaged background , a key factor that enables them to achieve positive life outcomes . ” 

this is excellent stuff , and it needs to be scaled up . it can be ! 

i am proposing and committed to supporting initiatives to expand the strategic direction of these existing organisations — such as the duke of edinburgh(PERSON) ’s award scheme — with the aim of reaching one(CARDINAL) million(CARDINAL) young people every year over the(DATE) next(DATE) five(DATE) years(DATE) . ideally , i would like even further roll - out of the program to embed the scheme within educational institutions and form part of the national curriculum . 

today(DATE) , i ’m starting a conversation ! 

how do we collaborate with and contribute to raising awareness of , and the broader roll - out of these impactful programs ? is the fact of them being voluntary to join actually a barrier to those who need it most ? please join the conversation and let me know what you think ! 

do you support youth services being part of the national curriculum ? then i urge you to tell your local police and crime commissioner and your mp !

kenya-haiti-reach-accord-enabling-police-deployment.htm : 

after facing opposition from a local court , kenya(GPE) plans to send 1,000(CARDINAL) police officers to haiti(GPE) to spearhead a united nations - approved operation to combat gang violence . on friday(DATE) ,(DATE) march(DATE) 1(DATE) , the two(CARDINAL) countries inked a security accord that nairobi(GPE) thinks would appease the caribbean(NORP) nation . 

gang violence 

as the violence escalated in 2022(DATE) , haiti(GPE) sought assistance but was unable to secure a nation ready to spearhead a relief effort . due to the country 's history of human rights violations , other countries have been hesitant to step in and support henry(PERSON) 's unelected regime .

the operation has been put on hold as a result of this , even though other nations have sent troops , and the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) and canada(GPE) have promised hundreds(MONEY) of(MONEY) millions(MONEY) of(MONEY) dollars(MONEY) for it .

rajinder(PERSON) rana(PERSON) , one(CARDINAL) of the six(CARDINAL) disqualified congress(ORG) mlas(ORG) in himachal(GPE) pradesh(GPE) , has claimed that many other legislators are in touch with them and that sukhvinder(PERSON) singh(PERSON) sukh(GPE) ’s government is on the verge of being toppled . 

rana(PERSON) also dismissed the chief minister ’s claim that some rebel mlas want to return to the party . " no one wants to return . on the other hand , at(CARDINAL) least(CARDINAL) nine(CARDINAL) more mlas are in touch with us , " he said . 

expressing complete dissatisfaction with the current dispensation , rana(PERSON) claimed that they had been raising concerns with the high command for more(DATE) than(DATE) a(DATE) year(DATE) that " everything is not right in the party " in himachal . 

“ it is not congress(ORG) ' government in himachal(GPE) pradesh(GPE) ; it is only the government of sukhvinder(ORG) sukhu(ORG) 's(ORG) friends . everyone is aware of the state 's situation , " he said . 

rana(PERSON) and five(CARDINAL) other mlas were disqualified after they cross - voted for bjp(ORG) candidate harsh mahajan in the recent rajya sabha election , leading to the stunning defeat of congress(ORG) ’s abhishek(ORG) manu(ORG) singhvi(ORG) . 

asked about it , rana(PERSON) said , " we took this decision to uphold the honour of himachal(GPE) pradesh(GPE) and its people . " 

rana(PERSON) hinted at the potential defections from within the party , claiming that at(CARDINAL) least(CARDINAL) nine(CARDINAL) mlas are in contact with him and the state government is on the verge of collapse . 

" several other mlas want to join us ( rebel mlas ) and are in contact with us . the state government of himachal will be toppled soon , " he said .

the - best - way - to - defend - the - right - to - protest - is - to - use - it : 

rishi(ORG) sunak doubled down on the tory crackdown against muslims(NORP) and the right to protest on friday(DATE) night(TIME) . the hastily - organised speech outside downing street is a sign of the panic ripping through the british(NORP) establishment over the(ORG) palestine(ORG) solidarity(ORG) movement(ORG) . 

it came on the(TIME) night(TIME) that george(PERSON) galloway(PERSON) won in the rochdale by - election , where voters punished sunak and keir(PERSON) starmer(PERSON) for supporting israel(GPE) ’s genocide . 

sunak took aim at the(FAC) palestine(FAC) movement(FAC) , claiming , “ in recent(DATE) weeks(DATE) and months(DATE) we have seen a shocking increase in extremist disruption and criminality . what started as protests on our streets have descended into intimidation , threats and planned acts of violence . 

“ now , our democracy itself is a target . council meetings and local events have been stormed . mps(PERSON) do not feel safe in their homes . longstanding parliamentary conventions have been upended because of safety concerns . ” he said the rochdale by - election result was “ beyond alarming ” . 

sunak said the tories would “ redouble our support for the prevent programme ” and “ demand universities stop extremist activity ” . he said it was “ unacceptable to beam antisemitic slogans ” onto parliament — a slur on the slogan , “ from the river to the sea , palestine(GPE) will be free . ” 

it ’s not so much what sunak said that ’s significant , but the fact that he said it at an unplanned broadcast . 

the(ORG) palestine(ORG) movement(ORG) has shaken up british(NORP) politics . it forced out a deeply reactionary home secretary and caused a huge crisis for keir(PERSON) starmer(PERSON) ’s(PERSON) leadership . now , sunak is desperate to repress it — and whip up islamophobia in the hope of shoring up right wing votes in the coming general election . 

the best response is to keep mobilising for palestine(GPE) and not let the state censor our legitimate slogans . and we have to fight back against islamophobia and the tories . 

sunak(PERSON) ’s speech comes after he and other tories had promised more repressive measures . home secretary james(PERSON) cleverly(PERSON) wants to increase the notice period protest organisers have to give police before large demonstrations . he wants to extend it from six(DATE) days(DATE) to a(DATE) couple(DATE) of(DATE) weeks(DATE) . 

the tories want the police to crack down on the protests , with sunak calling on police chiefs to use the powers they have to “ do whatever it takes ” . he said protests outside of mps(PERSON) ’ homes are intimidation and require an “ immediate response ” from police 

these calls for police repression are linked to the tories ramping up islamophobia to undermine the(ORG) palestine(ORG) movement(ORG) . sunak absurdly labelled the movement as “ simply undemocratic ” and claimed , “ there is a growing consensus that mob rule is replacing democratic rule . ” 

sunak gave a lengthy speech on wednesday(TIME) night(TIME) where he sought to demonise palestine(GPE) protesters and paint muslims(NORP) as an enemy within . “ we must also be far bolder and more assertive in defending our british(NORP) values , ” he said . 

“ we ’ve got to end this passive tolerance of words and actions that go against what we stand for . it is as un(NORP) -(NORP) british(NORP) as it is undemocratic . ” 

sunak is wheeling out the islamophobic trope that the protests — which have brought together the left and large numbers of muslims(NORP) — are “ un(NORP) -(NORP) british(NORP) ” . 

tom(PERSON) southerden(PERSON) , amnesty international british(NORP) law and human rights director , said , “ talk of ‘ mob rule ’ wildly exaggerates the issue and risks delegitimising the rights of peaceful protest . ” britain(GPE) “ has undergone a major crackdown on protests in recent(DATE) years(DATE) ” as protests are “ criminalised ” and “ the police being given sweeping powers to prevent protests taking place ” . 

but labour leader keir(PERSON) starmer(PERSON) disgracefully backed sunak . “ the prime minister is right to advocate unity and to condemn the unacceptable and intimidatory behaviour that we have seen recently . it is an important task of leadership to defend our values and the common bonds that hold us together . ” 

he is defending the values of state repression and imperialism . 

the home office announced a policy paper on wednesday(DATE) sinisterly called , “ defending democracy policing protocol ” . the paper says that police should “ direct protesters away ” from mps(PERSON) ’ homes . 

it also says that protesters outside of parliament , town halls , party offices or fundraisers are n’t allowed to prevent use or access to the venue or cause distress to those in the venue . a number of tory mps want to escalate this further , demanding protests outside of parliament or council chambers be completely banned . 

the(ORG) labour(ORG) party(ORG) believes that the home office ’s proposals are sensible , only disagreeing with the language . 

the stop the war coalition , of the organisers of the(ORG) palestine(ORG) demonstrations(ORG) , slammed the move . it committed to “ campaigning energetically ” against any attempts to ban protests outside parliament , council buildings or mps(PERSON) ’ offices . 

the coalition said the freedom of protest “ is needed more than ever ” . “ our politicians are refusing to reflect the demand of the overwhelming majority of the population for an immediate ceasefire in gaza(GPE) , ” it said . “ equating the right to protest with intimidation is completely spurious . ” 

the organisers of the palestine(NORP) marches have put together a dossier of the examples of restrictive and violent policing . 

this includes the attempt to ban the 11(CARDINAL) november demonstration , the constant imposing of restriction orders on the marches and the metropolitan police ’s violent arrests of protesters . 

on top of this , cleverly told palestinian(NORP) protesters to stop their regular protests because they have “ made their point ” . he told the times newspaper that protesters should recognise “ they ’ve made their point loudly and they ’re not adding to it by repeating themselves ” . 

but the march organisers said they will continue to mobilise in support of a free palestine . as long as israel(GPE) ’s genocide in gaza(GPE) continues — backed by the british(NORP) state — ordinary people will take to the streets in rage . 

we must n’t let politicians ’ attempts to demonise muslims(NORP) and the(ORG) palestine(ORG) solidarity(ORG) movement(ORG) and attack the right to protest succeed . the best way to defend protest rights is to use them — against the tory mob in downing street .

prof - takyiwaa - manuh - denies - allegations - of - being - paid - to - oppose - anti - gay - bill : 

a heated exchange has erupted between notable figures regarding the motivations behind opposition to the controversial legislation following the passage of ghana(GPE) ’s anti - lgbtq+ bill . 

a former director of the(ORG) institute(ORG) of(ORG) african(ORG) studies at the(ORG) university(ORG) of(ORG) ghana(ORG) , legon(GPE) , emerita professor takyiwaa manuh , has found herself at the center of this discourse following allegations made by member of parliament for ningo - prampram , samuel(PERSON) nartey(PERSON) george(PERSON) .(PERSON) 

sam(PERSON) george(PERSON) claimed that prof manuh , along with other prominent individuals , has been financially compensated by lgbtq+ groups to advocate against the anti - gay bill . 

in response to these accusations , prof manuh firmly denied the allegations and accused the mp of resorting to insults due to the perceived inadequacy of the bill . she argued that the legislation is redundant given existing laws prohibiting “ unnatural canal activities ” and the abuse of children . moreover , she expressed concerns that the bill could perpetuate discrimination and unwarranted attacks against the lgbt+ community . 

quoting the philosopher socrates , manuh(PERSON) asserted , “ when the debate is lost , insult becomes the loser ’s tool , ” suggesting that george(PERSON) ’s resort to personal attacks indicates a lack of substantive argument in favor of the bill . 

challenging george(PERSON) to provide evidence for his claims , manuh(PERSON) emphasized her intention to uphold her reputation through legal recourse if necessary . she asserted her belief in the protection of the law , stating that the burden of proof lies with those making the allegations . 

meanwhile , in his interview on adom(ORG) fm(ORG) , mp(PERSON) samuel(PERSON) nartey(PERSON) george(PERSON) reiterated his allegations against manuh and other individuals , accusing them of being funded by pro - lgbtq+ groups . he questioned the inconsistency in their opposition to the bill despite the existence of similar provisions in current laws . 

the promotion of human sexual rights and family values bill , now awaiting presidential assent , seeks to criminalize and penalize lgbt(ORG) activities(ORG) and their advocacy in ghana(GPE) . if signed into law , individuals engaging in such activities could face jail terms , while promoters and sponsors could also be subject to legal consequences . 

as the bill awaits presidential action , the nation remains divided , with proponents citing the preservation of traditional family values , while opponents raise concerns about human rights and the potential for discrimination . 

the outcome of this contentious legislative debate now hinges on the decision of president nana(PERSON) addo(PERSON) dankwa(PERSON) akufo(PERSON) -(PERSON) addo(PERSON) , whose approval or rejection of the bill will determine its fate .

MVBO3L5XP4U24JZ4R6ZXXXE24I(ORG) : 

former president donald(PERSON) trump(PERSON) won the missouri(GPE) caucuses saturday(DATE) afternoon(TIME) , inching his way closer to a formal grasp of the party ’s nomination for president . 

two(CARDINAL) other states were also holding republican(NORP) elections saturday(DATE) : idaho(GPE) and michigan(GPE) . but none of them were primaries . all were caucuses , which limit turnout by requiring participants to arrive at a specific time and usually to stay for a certain period to participate in a more formal process . 

caucus specifics vary from state to state , but they usually involve hearing speeches and then casting a vote . 

the(ORG) associated(ORG) press(ORG) called missouri(GPE) for trump at 12:40(TIME) p.m.(TIME) et . 

trump(PERSON) has won every single republican(NORP) nominating contest since the(DATE) year(DATE) began . he will face his only serious remaining challenger , former south(GPE) carolina(GPE) gov . nikki(PERSON) haley(PERSON) , in the numerous elections being held march(DATE) 5(DATE) , which is known as super tuesday(DATE) . 

saturday(DATE) 's loss was another indication that haley(PERSON) faces grim prospects for winning the nomination . 

caucuses limited participation 

in both idaho(GPE) and missouri(GPE) , state lawmakers canceled the republican(NORP) primary and replaced it with caucuses . 

this gave a small percentage of republicans(NORP) in the state control over who the party nominates . 

the last time idaho(GPE) held caucuses instead of a primary , in 2012(DATE) , only(CARDINAL) about(CARDINAL) 45,000(CARDINAL) people took part . that was about(CARDINAL) a(CARDINAL) fifth(CARDINAL) of all registered republicans(NORP) in the state . 

the timing of the caucuses was also an obstacle for many . idaho(GPE) , which is split between the mountain and pacific time zones , held its caucuses at 12:30(TIME) or(TIME) 1:30(TIME) in(TIME) the(TIME) afternoon(TIME) . missouri(GPE) held its caucuses at 10(TIME) a.m.(TIME) ct . 

michigan(GPE) ’s caucus convention was even more restricted 

in michigan(GPE) , which held its caucuses at 10(TIME) a.m.(TIME) et , the average voter could n’t even take part . 

michigan(GPE) did also hold a primary earlier in the(DATE) week(DATE) that allocated about(CARDINAL) a(CARDINAL) third(CARDINAL) of that state 's delegates . trump(PERSON) won that contest easily . 

but there was a scheduling conflict between the date set by michigan(GPE) ’s legislature , which is controlled by democrats(NORP) , and rules for the republican(NORP) nominating calendar set by the(ORG) republican(ORG) national(ORG) committee(ORG) . 

so the(ORG) michigan(ORG) gop(ORG) created a hybrid system in which a majority of the state ’s 55(CARDINAL) delegates are allocated based on a caucus convention . 

the caucus convention , being held saturday(DATE) , brought together around 2,000(CARDINAL) party activists from around the state who were selected at the county level . 

a state of confusion 

but the confusion in michigan(GPE) was made worse when activists last(DATE) year(DATE) accused state party chair kristina(PERSON) karamo(PERSON) of mismanaging the organization ’s finances . 

trump(PERSON) backed a different state party chair , former rep . pete(ORG) hoekstra(ORG) , as did the(ORG) republican(ORG) national(ORG) committee(ORG) . 

karamo(ORG) , however , refused to back down and organized a caucus convention of her own , separate from the caucus convention held by hoekstra(ORG) and his organization . 

only(DATE) one(DATE) day(DATE) before the two(CARDINAL) dueling meetings were set to take place , karamo(ORG) and her former staff bowed to the pressure from the(ORG) national(ORG) party(ORG) and canceled their competing caucus convention . 

heading into tuesday(DATE) 

though the votes might be small , the victory in missouri(GPE) , plus two(CARDINAL) more potential wins in michigan(GPE) and idaho(GPE) , give trump a little more momentum heading into super tuesday(DATE) . trump(PERSON) ’s campaign hopes to wrap up the primary race in the(DATE) coming(DATE) weeks(DATE) — or as soon as tuesday(DATE) night(TIME) , should haley(PERSON) drop out . 

as for staying in the race , haley(PERSON) has said that march(DATE) 5(DATE) is “ as far as i ’ve thought in terms of going forward . ”

plight - of - nigerian(NORP) - professors - in - cameroon : 

it has been over six(DATE) years(DATE) since some professors of nigerian(NORP) universities were kidnapped at nera hotel in abuja(GPE) .(GPE) 

they were meeting to discuss the welfare of cameroonian(NORP) refugees who had fled for their lives into nigerian(NORP) territory , when they were kidnapped at gun point by 20-(CARDINAL) armed men on 5th(ORDINAL) january(DATE) 2018(DATE) . the academics were handcuffed and held in an underground detention facility of the department of state services ( dss ) for 20(DATE) days(DATE) . 

later , they were repatriated to cameroon , with the assistance of the administration of the then - president muhammadu(PERSON) buhari(PERSON) , despite the fact that they were legally resident in nigeria(GPE) as refugees and registered asylum seekers . 

at cameroon(GPE) , they were brought before a military tribunal , tried in french(NORP) , even though they were english(LANGUAGE) speaking , with no provision of a translator and sentenced to life imprisonment at the kondengui maximum security detention facility with a fine of us$525(CARDINAL) million(CARDINAL) . 

this action has been widely criticised globally . 

a federal high court in abuja(ORG) on(ORG) march(ORG) 1st(ORG) ,(ORG) 2019(ORG) , and november(DATE) 28th(DATE) ,(DATE) 2019(DATE) recognized the violations of their rights . 

the judge ruled that the state must pay n5 million ( us$13,800 ) to each detainee for violating their fundamental rights , including the right to life , dignity , fair hearing , health , freedom of movement , and association . 

additionally , n200,000(PERSON) in damages was awarded for deportation . the court issued a perpetual injunction against further violations and ordered the deportees ’ return to nigeria(GPE) promptly . 

the un(ORG) human rights special procedures working group based in geneva(GPE) , switzerland(GPE) earlier called on the government of cameroon to release them . because of the violation of their human rights citing that “ the manner in which the complainants were arrested , detained in nigeria(GPE) , transferred to cameroon , detained , tried , and sentenced to life imprisonment violated various international laws to which both cameroon(GPE) and nigeria(GPE) are signatories to . ” 

the group also asked that cameroon(GPE) and nigeria(GPE) remedy the situation and “ accord them an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations , in accordance with international law . ” 

heather(PERSON) nauert(PERSON) , the(ORG) us(ORG) department(ORG) of(ORG) state(ORG) spokesperson , emphasized that the actions of nigeria(GPE) and cameroon violated the detainees ’ rights by forcibly repatriating them . she urged both governments to adhere to their international obligations and refrain from such actions . many rights groups have criticized the imprisonment , calling for their release but years(DATE) down the line they are still in detention . 

ogaba oga , a legal practitioner , explains that refugees in nigeria(GPE) are afforded various legal rights through both national and international instruments . the(ORG) national(ORG) refugee(ORG) commission(ORG) act(ORG) of 1989(DATE) establishes fundamental protections , including non - refoulement , access to basic needs like food and shelter , the right to work and education within national regulations , and freedom of movement within nigeria(GPE) . 

internationally , nigeria(GPE) is bound by the refugee convention of 1951(DATE) , which reinforces these rights . besides , refugees are protected under the convention against torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and the universal declaration of human rights .

gillis ' family and friends shouted ' bye kevin(PERSON) '(PERSON) , ' you coward ' and ' justice served ' as he was marched out in handcuffs . 

the defense asked for leniency . monahan(PERSON) declined an opportunity to speak . 

' i think it 's important for people to know that it 's not ok to shoot people and have them killed for turning down your driveway , ' judge adam(PERSON) michelini(PERSON) said . 

apart from the wider deterrent effect , michelini said it 's important that monahan(PERSON) remain behind bars rather than be free to harm more people . 

on the(TIME) night(TIME) of gillis ' death , the group of friends had realized their error and had turned around when monahan(PERSON) fired a second(ORDINAL) shot , striking gillis in the neck as she sat in the front passenger seat of an suv(ORG) driven by her boyfriend .

prosecutors argued that monahan(PERSON) was motivated by an irrational rage toward trespassers . 

a jury deliberated for less(TIME) then(TIME) two(TIME) hours(TIME) before returning guilty verdicts in january(DATE) against monahan(PERSON) for murder , reckless endangerment and tampering with physical evidence . 

the father of gilis(ORG) previously told of his grief at losing his daughter so suddenly , and said he hopes monahan(PERSON) ' dies in jail '

gillis ' father , andrew(PERSON) gillis(PERSON) , has described his daughter as someone who loved animals and had dreams of becoming a marine biologist or a veterinarian . 

' every day we wake up to the harsh reality that that she´s(GPE) no longer here . we will never see her beautiful face , hear her laughter , ' gillis said in court friday(DATE) before monahan(PERSON) 's sentence was announced . 

her boyfriend , blake(PERSON) walsh(PERSON) , was behind the wheel of the suv(ORG) that(TIME) night(TIME) . ' i will never be able to forgive you , ' he told monahan(PERSON) , who looked on with a stony face . 

' you took the life of someone who never was a threat to you , not for a second(ORDINAL) , ' walsh said .

gillis(PERSON) 's friend whiting told the killer , ' once in a while , i feel slightly bad for you , wondering what made you turn out this way and why , and wondering if you truly feel guilty about what you did . ' 

' you made a decision that altered all of our lives forever , all because you spent three(TIME) minutes(TIME) in fear , ' she said .

weld - recruiting - military - veterans - families - to - serve - as - poll - workers : 

weld recruiting military veterans , families to serve as poll workers 

wheeling – west(GPE) virginia(GPE) senate(ORG) majority whip ryan(PERSON) weld(PERSON) believes military veterans could make ideal poll workers at election time , and he wants to recruit them to provide that public service . 

weld , r(ORG) -(ORG) brooke(ORG) , is himself an air force veteran , and he knows what training these citizens have . 

“ veterans make good poll workers , ” he said . “ think about the skills we learn in the military – organization , teamwork . 

“ when you are in a voting precinct , you have to be organized and you have to be able to work with others . you have to be able to get everything in order . ” 

in the military , recruits are taught all about following procedures , weld continued . 

“ and that is what elections are about – from the time you open until the time you close . ” 

weld announced on friday(DATE) a partnership with nonprofit vet the vote to encourage mountain state vets and their families to volunteer as poll workers in this(DATE) year(DATE) ’s elections . 

“ without a doubt , veterans are the most trusted demographic in the nation , ” he said . “ and we can think of no better group to step up and help solve our election volunteer shortage . 

“ we are asking our veterans to serve once again and help ensure that all west virginians who are able to vote in this(DATE) year(DATE) ’s(DATE) election can , ” he added . 

west(GPE) virginia(GPE) will need more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 8,400(CARDINAL) volunteer poll workers to help in both this year(DATE) ’s primary and general elections . by appealing to the state ’s veteran community , this initiative hopes to ease the burden on west(GPE) virginia(GPE) ’s(GPE) county clerks as they seek to find a sufficient number of poll workers this(DATE) year(DATE) . 

dan(PERSON) vallone(PERSON) , a veteran of the(ORG) u.s(ORG) army(ORG) and director of vet the vote , said that the state ’s veterans and military families have always stepped forward to serve their communities . 

“ as trusted members of the community with a deep commitment to service , veterans and military families can play a unique role in addressing the urgent need for poll workers here in west(GPE) virginia(GPE) and across the country , ” vallone(PERSON) said . “ and by encouraging them to answer this call , we hope to forge a new tradition of patriotic civic engagement among veterans and military families . ” 

the west(GPE) virginia(GPE) county clerks association has stepped up to assist with the vet the vote effort to ensure participation in each of the state ’s 55(CARDINAL) counties . weld , who is also chairman of the(ORG) senate(ORG) military(ORG) committee(ORG) , is the lead sponsor of senate(ORG) resolution 61(DATE) , encouraging west(GPE) virginia(GPE) military veterans to volunteer as election workers in 2024(DATE) statewide elections . the resolution highlights the critical skills veterans bring to the administration of elections and that their participation as poll workers will help continue our citizens ’ strong sense of confidence in the electoral process . 

he also believes veterans should want to serve as poll workers , as they have already established a pattern of self - service . 

“ they should want to make sure that one of our fundamental rights is available , and always available , ” weld said . “ in states where there are not enough poll workers they are consolidating precincts and decreasing the number of check - in tables . this leads to longer lines and impedes a person ’s fundamental right to vote . 

“ you ( as a veteran ) have already made the decision to serve once before . please do so again by volunteering again as a poll worker . you will be ensuring the rights you worked to ensure while you were in uniform are still able to be enjoyed today(DATE) – such as the fundamental right to vote . ” 

weld suggests that if anyone wants to serve as poll worker for the upcoming election they stop by their county ’s elections office – which is in most local counties the county clerk ’s office . 

in ohio(GPE) county(GPE) , those wanting to be poll workers should contact the(ORG) ohio(ORG) county(ORG) commission(ORG) office at 304(CARDINAL) - 234 - 3628 . 

poll worker training classes begin april(DATE) 15(DATE) in time for the may 14(CARDINAL) primary election .

alro - insists - its - not - parks - land : 

the agricultural land reform office ( alro ) on saturday(DATE) insisted that all disputed land plots near khao(GPE) yai(GPE) were lawfully designated as agricultural land and did not overlap with national park land as claimed by the(ORG) department(ORG) of(ORG) national(ORG) park(ORG) , wildlife and plant conservation ( dnp(ORG) ) . 

alro(PERSON) 's secretary - general vinaroj sapsongsuk said alro and the dnp(ORG) had previously agreed to work together to examine the land ownership disagreements near the park . 

the land in question , located in ban hew pla(PERSON) kang(PERSON) in tambon(GPE) mu(GPE) si(GPE) of pak(PERSON) chong(PERSON) district of nakhon(ORG) ratchasima(ORG) , belongs to the alro , mr(PERSON) vinaroj(PERSON) said . 

he cited findings from a recent survey conducted by the royal thai survey department ( rtsd ) which said the land is not a part of the park . 

he said about(QUANTITY) 33,896(QUANTITY) rai(QUANTITY) of land was handed over to the(ORG) ministry(ORG) of(ORG) agriculture(ORG) and(ORG) cooperatives(ORG) in 1962(DATE) to be implemented in a land reform scheme . 

then , on dec(DATE) 26(DATE) ,(DATE) 1984(DATE) , a boundary marking in khao(PERSON) yai(PERSON) was conducted , he said , noting the action was approved by the alro and the(ORG) royal(ORG) forest(ORG) department(ORG) , which at the time oversaw national parks in the country . 

at the time , approximately(PERCENT) 86.25(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) of such land was occupied for agricultural purposes , he said . 

alro therefore began allocating rights to use the land to farmers following the enactment of the 1975(DATE) agricultural land reform act , mr(PERSON) vinaroj(PERSON) said . 

if the government wants to demarcate the land and turn it into a buffer zone , a formal amendment of the law is needed , he said , adding compensation for farmers currently occupying the land should also be granted . 

an alro committee would continue to investigate its provincial officers over their alleged misconduct in the issuing of sor(ORG) por(ORG) kor(ORG) documents ( title deeds ) on forest land , he said , adding these alro officials have been transferred to make way for the probe , and would face disciplinary action as well as criminal and civil charges if found guilty .

second(ORDINAL) - galaxy - s24 - software - update - is - out : 

the galaxy s24 is picking up the march(DATE) 2024(DATE) security update 

the latest update is just a bug fix and stability update to keep your phone secure and running smoothly . 

what you need to know 

- samsung just released a fresh software update for the galaxy s24 series , featuring the march(DATE) 2024(DATE) security patch . 

- unlike the previous update , which added a " vividness " slider , this one prioritizes security and stability improvements . 

- galaxy s24 users in canada(GPE) and the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) are already reporting the update . 

samsung(ORG) just dropped a fresh software update for the galaxy s24 series , packing the march(DATE) 2024(DATE) security patch . 

the update kicked off in late(DATE) february(DATE) , right after a firmware drop that improved the camera and tweaked display colors . but it was initially limited to users in south(GPE) korea(GPE) , as per sammobile . 

the newest patch brings a firmware version ending with axbg(ORG) . unlike the one(CARDINAL) from two(DATE) weeks(DATE) ago(DATE) that introduced a " vividness " slider in advanced display settings , this time it 's all about beefing up security and stability . 

samsung(ORG) 's official release notes for the update do not spotlight any changes . however , with the hefty 428(QUANTITY) mb(QUANTITY) firmware size , chances are it 's packing just the march(DATE) 2024(DATE) security patch and a sprinkle of minor bug fixes . 

reports are rolling in from galaxy s24 users in canada(GPE) and the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) , saying they 're snagging the update on their phones . it 's also anticipated to hit more countries in the(DATE) next(DATE) few(DATE) days(DATE) . 

if you 're wondering if your shiny new device scored the patch , dive into your settings app . once you 're in , go to the software update section . if the update is ready for you , there should be a nifty button saying " download and install . " 

samsung(ORG) is keeping its reputation as one of the top dogs in the smartphone world by sticking to the routine of dropping monthly(DATE) security updates . sure , the february(DATE) 2024(DATE) update took a fashionably late entrance for the flagship galaxy devices , but the company bounced back in style . the march update is out and about , beating google to the punch . 

while the galaxy s24 is first(ORDINAL) to pick up the march patch , naturally , older models like the galaxy s23 , z(CARDINAL) fold(CARDINAL) 5(CARDINAL) , and z(CARDINAL) flip 5(CARDINAL) are getting their turn later in the(DATE) month(DATE) .

wildfires devastate areas of nebraska(GPE) , texas(GPE) , kansas(GPE) and oklahoma(GPE) 

dry , hot conditions have sparked wildfires from nebraska(GPE) to the texas(GPE) panhandle . 

the(ORG) smokehouse(ORG) creek(ORG) and other fires in the texas(GPE) panhandle have had a devastating impact on area residents , destroying homes , vehicles , livestock and , so far , one(CARDINAL) human lives . 

the fire is being billed as the largest in the state at 1,640(QUANTITY) square(QUANTITY) miles(QUANTITY) , just behind the 2006(DATE) east amarillo complex fire that burned 1,400(QUANTITY) square(QUANTITY) miles(QUANTITY) and killed 13(CARDINAL) people . 

texas(ORG) agriculture(ORG) commissioner sid(PERSON) miller(PERSON) estimated that thousands(CARDINAL) of cattle have been killed or will have to be euthanized because of the fire . 

unfortunately , as i write this there is still danger from smokehouse(ORG) creek(ORG) fire and several others blazing in the texas(GPE) panhandle and parts of oklahoma(GPE) . 

my heart goes out to these people and all of us here at the fence post are praying that you all recover . 

i have never gone through a fire in my life , and i hope i never have to experience such devastation . but it never ceases to amaze me the size and scope of the generosity of people that go out of their way to help others in their time of need . 

already i ’ve seen emails and messages from all over the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) organizing fundraisers and asking what they can do to help . donations have already started to roll in and lists have been distributed about current needs . 

in response to the fires in central nebraska(GPE) an informational meeting is being held on march(DATE) 12(DATE) at 6:30(TIME) p.m.(TIME) at the west central research , extension and education center in north platte to address documenting losses . 

these fires remind us that there is really no wildfire season . weather conditions at any time of the(DATE) year(DATE) can create conditions conducive to fire and we need to always be on alert . 

let ’s hope these areas get some much - needed moisture to keep wildfires at bay .

modern - means - to - meet - declining - agricultural - production : 

yk poudel 

agricultural production in bhutan(GPE) has been declining over the(DATE) years(DATE) , with the nation producing 70,168(QUANTITY) metric(QUANTITY) tonnes(QUANTITY) of primary cereals in 2022(DATE) . to address this concerning trend , the(ORG) ministry(ORG) of(ORG) agriculture(ORG) and livestock ( moal(ORG) ) is implementing strategic measures focusing on farm mechanissation , irrigation , and the cultivation of high - value crops . 

during the first(ORDINAL) meet - the - press on february(DATE) 29(DATE) , agriculture minister younten(PERSON) phuntsho(PERSON) identified several contributing factors to this decline . these include challenges related to landholding , limited access to finance for agricultural activities , climate - induced adversities , water supply for irrigation , and post - harvest management issues . 

“ there ’s a shift towards economically viable , less labour - intensive crops over paddy cultivation in wetlands , ” he said . 

in the upcoming 13th(ORDINAL) five(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) plan , the ministry , minister said , would prioritise the enhancement of high - value crop production and the strengthening of farm co - operatives . 

he further highlighted the importance of the(ORG) gyalsung(ORG) national(ORG) service(ORG) in promoting food security through advancements in agriculture technology , protected agriculture , and drip irrigation . 

efforts will be made , he said , to improve farm mechanisation , enhance irrigation water supply , and facilitate easier access to finance for farmers . 

the ministry has plans to address trade challenges related to pricing , accessibility , and transportation based on reports from the(ORG) department(ORG) of(ORG) agriculture(ORG) . 

the plans also include the introduction of new crop varieties . 

the(DATE) 13th(DATE) five(DATE) -(DATE) year(DATE) plan emphasises the commercial production of high - value organic agricultural commodities such as asparagus , broccoli , quinoa , strawberry , cauliflower , buckwheat , and adzuki beans . 

additionally , the plan proposes the production of new high - value livestock commodities including rainbow trout , sturgeon caviar , yak cheese and fiber , putka and comba(ORG) honey(ORG) , yagyu cheese , and royal jelly . 

investments in climate - smart and disaster - resilient irrigation facilities for farmers will receive special focus . 

the integrated agriculture and livestock census of bhutan 2022(DATE) reveals a decline in the production of primary cereals compared to 2021(DATE) , with paddy , maize , wheat , buckwheat , barley , and millet being the primary cereals cultivated . 

the census data also indicates that a significant portion of farmers are above the(DATE) age(DATE) of(DATE) 65(DATE) , with females being overrepresented in age categories up(DATE) to(DATE) 54(DATE) years(DATE) . this suggests a need for initiatives to attract and support younger farmers , particularly females , to sustain agricultural activities . 

despite witnessing growth in gross domestic product ( gdp ) and gross national income ( gni ) in 2022(DATE) , there was a contraction in the contribution of the primary sector . crop production registered a negative growth rate in 2022(DATE) , highlighting the urgency of implementing strategies to revitalise the agricultural sector for sustainable economic growth .

“ if we do n’t receive any positive response from the authorities involved , we will protest against them on friday(DATE) . we are tired of this situation , ” said the students , who feel that their education and future careers are at stake and are demanding a concrete plan of action from the university . 

the students claim that despite numerous meetings and discussions with the vice chancellor , the acting provost , and the surgery department about the issue , no progress has been made . 

they believe “ there is a conflict of interest ” between the university and the surgery department , with the students suffering as a result . 

the lack of tangible action and proper communication has left the students feeling undervalued and unsupported in their pursuit of education and training , perceived the students , who have given the university authorities a two(DATE) -(DATE) day(DATE) deadline to come up with a definitive solution . 

faal(ORG) said the students are demanding accountability , swift action , and a clear resolution to the delay , emphasising that their academic and professional growth can not afford any further setbacks . 

they acknowledge that they have exhausted diplomatic approaches and are now compelled to take a more radical approach to bring about change . 

they are calling for the intervention of the chancellor and are using the slogan , “ we are tired of being neglected . we are tired of the continuous delays in the medical school . ” 

however , the frustrations of the medical students have highlight the urgent need for the university authorities to address their concerns and find a satisfactory resolution to the delay in the medical school curriculum .

national(ORG) institute(ORG) of flamenco ( nif(PERSON) ) executive director and unm dance professor marisol encinias has just been named a national association of latino arts and cultures ( nalac ) 2024(DATE) advocacy leadership fellow . 

art administration is anything that involves the work that makes it possible for the arts to take place . it ’s the logistics behind it . one(CARDINAL) of my areas of interest as an artist and scholar is community work in the arts and how they can take place in a community in an effective way . what kind of access does the community have to art programming , performance and education ? 

“ i ’m very excited about the possibility of continuing to learn what i can bring back . being a rep of this work and being selected to be part of this conversation i think says there are some interesting things happening at unm , " encinias said . " being part of this will help me continue to learn and grow to be even more effective . ” 

the nalac is the nation ’s premier nonprofit organization exclusively dedicated to the promotion , advancement , development , and cultivation of the latino arts field . encinias was chosen as just one(CARDINAL) of 13(CARDINAL) fellows to enhance cultural advocacy in her community . 

“ the cohort of people selected for this have a lot of experience , across different mediums and genres of the arts . i 'm excited to be able to be a part of this cohort and learn and think about how i can be more effective in advocating for my community at a local or national level , ” encinias said . 

in addition to countless hours(TIME) spent teaching , choreographing and performing flamenco across many different stages , especially at unm , encinias serves as the artistic director and curator of festival flamenco alburquerque . her newest work , mestizx(ORG) ( feb(DATE) 2024(DATE) ) , is a work of flamenco dance theatre and is performed by unm - hosted yjastros(NORP) : the american(NORP) flamenco repertory company . 

“ i think it says that there is interesting work that is taking place through flamenco and in the arts that represent latin(NORP) american(NORP) culture in albuquerque , ” she said . “ it says the work is interesting enough that the future we ’re headed to and really what we 're doing at unm and in flamenco will be even brighter and more impactful . ” 

she has also helped found a charter school , tierra adentro , that offers a model of culturally relevant and academic success in new(GPE) mexico(GPE) . this balance between education and community is one she hopes to perfect with this fellowship . 

“ i ’ve learned in new(GPE) mexico(GPE) what the role of arts in youth is . i ’m interested in seeing how there can be better practices and better help for the creative art industry , ” encinias said . “ it ’s hard to have stability , so in my arts practice i want to learn how we can address issues of social justice through government connections and make art more equitable . ” 

the 2024(DATE) cohort will focus on a two(DATE) -(DATE) month(DATE) virtual program led by nalac faculty and staff , featuring a curriculum centered on advocacy , civic participation , legislation , and policy efforts for arts and cultural workers . 

following the virtual program , nalac staff , ali(ORG) faculty(ORG) , and fellows will come together in washington(GPE) , d.c(GPE) .(GPE) , to meet with federal arts agencies , smithsonian(ORG) institutional(ORG) leaders , and state and u.s(GPE) representatives(GPE) to advocate for congressional priorities in arts and culture legislation on behalf of the nonprofit arts and culture field . the visit will include sessions on capitol(ORG) hill(ORG) and with the(ORG) national(ORG) assembly(ORG) of(ORG) state(ORG) arts(ORG) agencies(ORG) , national endowment for the arts , archives of american(NORP) art , pew research center , and americans(NORP) for the arts . 

“ this is for people who are interested in being involved in art administration . it ’s for getting training in art advocacy through the government and learning how to try to make change on a larger level . we ’ll get that training , ” encinias said . 

encinias invites the community to join her in this greater embrace of arts in new(GPE) mexico(GPE) , by coming to the 37th(ORDINAL) annual festival alburquerque at unm in june(DATE) . 

“ these ideas of advocacy and what we ’re trying to do will be put forward into the festival representation of artists and how we treat artists in the process , ” she said . “ i imagine once i ’m exposed i will try to incorporate the ideas and experiences in that as an artist . it will probably have an influence on the work that we ’re doing in june(DATE) . ”

this - online - learning - program - is - teaching - preschoolers - in - crisis - situations : 

this online learning program is teaching preschoolers in crisis situations 

mary(PERSON) louise(PERSON) kelly(PERSON) , host : 

over the(DATE) past(DATE) couple(DATE) of(DATE) years(DATE) , millions(CARDINAL) of kids in the(LOC) middle(LOC) east(LOC) have been tuning into a remote learning program called " ahlan simsim . " 

( soundbite of tv show , " ahlan simsim " ) 

unidentified musical group : ( singing in arabic(NORP) ) . 

kelly(PERSON) : the title means " welcome sesame " in arabic(LANGUAGE) . it is an arabic(LANGUAGE) - language show from the sesame workshop created for children affected by conflict and featuring muppets called basma , jad , ameera alongside old regulars like elmo(ORG) . 

( soundbite of tv show , " ahlan simsim " ) 

unidentified actor : ( as elmo(ORG) , speaking arabic(NORP) ) . 

kelly(PERSON) : well , the show , as reporter anya(PERSON) kamenetz(PERSON) describes it , is the largest - ever humanitarian intervention specifically intended for small children 's development . she 's written about it in a piece for the mit technology review . hey there , anya(PERSON) . 

anya(PERSON) kamenetz(PERSON) : hey , mary(PERSON) louise(PERSON) . 

kelly(PERSON) : so i know there 's this huge push to get this programming in front of kids , especially kids who may be refugees , who 've been displaced by war . give me a sense of what it is because it 's not just a show , right ? how does this work ? 

kamenetz(PERSON) : so there 's different aspects of this program . so in the big picture , there 's been about(CARDINAL) almost(CARDINAL) 30(CARDINAL) million(CARDINAL) children in the(DATE) last(DATE) few(DATE) years(DATE) that have just watched this show across various different types of networks and organizations . and then the irc , international rescue committee , partnership was taking those videos and pairing them with basically a preschool program . but what happened was in the(DATE) early(DATE) weeks(DATE) of the pandemic , they had to pivot that program . so they decided that they were going to see if they could use whatsapp to deliver basically online preschool in collaboration with these videos at the same time . 

kelly(PERSON) : and i thought some of the details that you reported are fascinating in terms of the content , things they 're including , things they 're intentionally not including . an example that caught my eye - no nutrition lessons for kids because these are kids who are barely getting enough to eat . they do n't need to be lectured on , like , choose healthy vegetables . 

kamenetz(PERSON) : yeah , it 's really heartbreaking . i mean , as part of the reporting , i get a chance to communicate by zoom with some of these families . and they mentioned to me that , you know , the kids - they 're not even able right now to buy milk or yogurt . they 're buying pita and za'atar(NORP) spices . and so , yes , they left out nutrition . they also really had to think about the trauma that these kids had been through . so a very typical thing that you 'd see on a preschoolers ' program is a boat , and they did n't include boats . 

kelly(PERSON) : and the no boats - this is because so many have been refugees and had to take boat journeys , or ... 

kamenetz(PERSON) : that 's right . they 're aiming at - you know , primarily at syrian(NORP) refugees living in camps in lebanon(GPE) . just the idea of people having to leave their home is something that they had to really address in a very delicate way . 

kelly(PERSON) : oh , yeah . that 's heartbreaking . one(CARDINAL) challenge that occurs to me is that if you 're going to do remote learning like this , you need a solid internet connection . you need a device to engage with it . has that been an obstacle ? 

kamenetz(PERSON) : oh , my gosh , yes . i mean , you had families - you know , they 're going up on the rooftop to get a better connection . they 're borrowing phones from other family members , showing how committed these families were to making sure that the kids had this learning and this social - emotional services . 

kelly(PERSON) : well , i guess my next question is , does it work ? i know that researchers at nyu(ORG) , new(ORG) york(ORG) university(ORG) , have studied that . 

kamenetz(PERSON) : that 's right . so when they looked at the case of pairing the videos - the(ORG) "(ORG) ahlan(ORG) simsim(ORG) " program - with the services , which was whatsapp calls with preschool teachers and kids , they found that an 11(DATE) -(DATE) week(DATE) program produced almost(DATE) a(DATE) year(DATE) 's(DATE) worth of learning and even social - emotional progress . so 11(DATE) weeks(DATE) of this online programming , the kids are gaining as much as they would with a(DATE) year(DATE) of regular preschool . 

kelly(PERSON) : wow . how do they explain that ? 

kamenetz(PERSON) : it 's really amazing , right ? so first(ORDINAL) of all , you have to understand , obviously , the context here . about(CARDINAL) a(CARDINAL) third(CARDINAL) of the mothers in these families were illiterate themselves . and so with the preschool teachers , a lot of times , they are leaving voice memos instead of messages , and they are literally coaching the parents to write letters to show their children how to do it . and so what sherrie(PERSON) westin(PERSON) and other folks at sesame told me and people on the ground told me was it just is a testament to the dedication and the amount of reverence that these families had for education . 

kelly(PERSON) : are there any lessons here for remote learning outside of crisis zones ? i 'm thinking of , you know , american(NORP) kids , many of whom - most of whom did remote learning during the pandemic . and i do n't know of any parents - this is anecdotal . but as a parent myself , i do n't know of anybody who thought their kid in 11(DATE) weeks(DATE) achieved what they would have in a year(DATE) 's worth of actual real school . 

kamenetz(PERSON) : absolutely not . and so this is something that we should be cautious about overgeneralizing because remote learning is not anyone 's first(ORDINAL) choice , and it should n't be . but what really is remarkable about how they structured this program was that this is a full - family engagement programs . and it 's sort of a misnomer , in a way , to think of it as online learning , at least in a passive way . so i think that that 's really important to keep in mind . 

kelly(PERSON) : npr(ORG) alum anya(PERSON) kamenetz(PERSON) . she 's now a freelance education reporter . her piece in the mit technology review is headlined " yes , remote learning can work for preschoolers . " thanks , anya(PERSON) .

“ you do n’t need a phd from mit to make a difference in the fight for algorithmic justice . all you need is a curious mind and a human heart . "joy(PERSON) buolamwini(PERSON) , phd(PERSON) , “ unmasking ai ” 

in 2023(DATE) , english(LANGUAGE) - language global media quoted five(CARDINAL) male figures in artificial intelligence ( ai ) – elon musk , sam(PERSON) altman(PERSON) , geoffrey(PERSON) hinton(PERSON) , jensen(PERSON) huang(PERSON) and greg(PERSON) brockman(PERSON) – eight(CARDINAL) times more frequently than all 42(CARDINAL) women ai experts highlighted in time magazine 's top 100(CARDINAL) list of ai influencers , which includes names like grimes , margrethe vestager , timnit(PERSON) gebru(PERSON) , margaret(PERSON) mitchell(PERSON) , emily(PERSON) bender(PERSON) and joy(PERSON) buolamwini(PERSON) .(PERSON) 

this gender bias , uncovered by akas(ORG) ' analysis of 5(CARDINAL) million(CARDINAL) online news articles in 2023(DATE) that reference ai on gdelt(ORG) global(ORG) online(ORG) news(ORG) database , has flown under journalism ’s radar . mitigating gender bias in discussions around ai is an important way to ensure that news reflects the diversity of our world , and is relevant to as wide an audience as possible . 

i spoke with several experts about biases in generative ai , including gender bias , and the role of journalism in breaking these biases . 

the three(CARDINAL) man - made biases created by generative ai 

the existence of biases baked into generative ai ( genai ) – which includes chatgpt(ORG) , google(ORG) 's bard , and image generators like midjourney(PERSON) – quiets , distorts , and silences if not outright erases the voices of certain underrepresented groups . 

this is because generative ai amplifies societal biases through the datasets it uses in algorithms to generate text , images and video that use an unrepresentative small group as a default for the whole global population . 

programmers ' own perspectives of the world also inform the algorithms they develop , adding further bias to generated content . for example , facial recognition technology , used in policing , is disproportionately based on data from white ( 80(MONEY) per(MONEY) cent(MONEY) ) and male ( 75(MONEY) per(MONEY) cent(MONEY) ) faces . 

while the accuracy is 99(QUANTITY) -(QUANTITY) 100(QUANTITY) per(QUANTITY) cent(QUANTITY) in detecting white male faces , it falls sharply to 65(MONEY) per(MONEY) cent(MONEY) for black women . similarly , genai - assisted news articles are heavily reliant on a historical pool of articles in which men 's share of contributor / protagonist voices is multiple times higher than that of women . 

algorithms created with these biases become what joy buolamwini refers to in her new book , unmasking ai , as " the coded gaze " ( i.e. the priorities , preferences and even the prejudices of coders reflected in the products they have shaped ) . the groups who are underrepresented become " the excoded " ( i.e. individuals or communities that are harmed by algorithmic systems ) . the " coded gaze " deepens biases that exist in the datasets . 

a third(ORDINAL) layer of bias comes from product users , for instance the early adopters of genai text generators like chatgpt(ORG) or image generators like midjourney(GPE) , dall - e and stable diffusion . in the words of octavia sheepshanks , journalist and ai researcher , " what often does n't get mentioned is the fact that it 's the people using the images that have also shaped the image generator models . " 

these early product users further shape the ai - generated content through the way in which they interact with the products , with their own biases being fed back to the self - learning algorithms . 

global - northern - white - male dominated perspectives 

what do these datasets , programmers and product users all have in common ? they are overwhelmingly more likely to represent the perspectives , values and tastes of english(LANGUAGE) - speaking white men from cultures in the northern hemisphere . 

in an august(DATE) 2023(DATE) content analysis of chatgpt(ORG) , which explores how gender and race influences the portrayal of ceos in chatgpt(ORG) ’s content , kalev(PERSON) leetaru(PERSON) , founder of the gdelt project , concluded that " the end result raises existential gender and racial bias questions " about large language models ( llms ) . 

for example , while chatgpt(ORG) had described successful white male ceos in terms of their skills , successful female ceos and ceos of colour were described in terms of their identity and ability to fight adversity , rather than their competency - based skillset . 

libertarian views that value defending freedom of expression and protecting innovation online over interventionism pervade big tech and engineering schools . they present a roadblock to addressing bias in ai . 

hany farid , a computer science professor at the(ORG) university(ORG) of(ORG) california(ORG) ,(ORG) berkeley(ORG) , worries that these views mask ethical ignorance at best , or an underlying apathy and lack of care on the part of the ai sector at worst . they represent , he argues , " a dangerous way to look at the world , especially when you focus on the harms that have been done to women , children , and under - represented groups , societies and democracies . " 

- read more : how journalists can combat ai bias 

journalism adds a fourth(ORDINAL) impediment to tackling the problem of genai bias 

there is a danger that journalists are also helping write women and other underrepresented groups out of the future of ai . currently , only a small minority of tech news editors in the us(GPE) ( 18(MONEY) per(MONEY) cent(MONEY) ) and the uk(GPE) ( 23(MONEY) per(MONEY) cent(MONEY) ) are women . 

furthermore , in ai news coverage women are featured as experts , contributors or protagonists four(CARDINAL) times less frequently than men , according to our gdelt(PERSON) analysis . 

when we overlay the race dimension onto gender , the problem is compounded in several ways . firstly(ORDINAL) , women of colour are significantly more likely than men or white women to be left out of editorial decision - making and as contributors to stories . secondly(ORDINAL) , when they are interviewed , women of colour are much more likely to be asked questions based on their identity rather than their expertise . 

agnes(PERSON) stenbom(PERSON) , head of in / lab in schibsted , sweden(GPE) warns that news organisations must be mindful of their use of gendered language – for example , not assuming that doctors are men and nurses women – as this can “ further cement ” gendered biases . 

lars damgaard(PERSON) nielsen(PERSON) , ceo and co - founder of denmark(GPE) ’s mediacatch(ORG) , warns that women of colour are especially underrepresented in the news in denmark(GPE) . this is reflected in how people of coloir are portrayed in the news , according to an analysis last(DATE) year(DATE) using mediacatch(ORG) ’s ai - based tool diversitycatch , which showed that " non - western individuals are often not there because of their professional expertise , but because of their identity . " 

journalism must act as a watchdog for genai technology to mitigate existing biases 

the most effective way to mitigate homogeneity - related biases is to create more inclusive datasets , as buolamwini argues in her book . however , regulators and journalists face a significant challenge that they should push back against – they do not know the exact data that ai draws from due to the ai industry ’s lack of transparency . 

" transparency is becoming more and more limited . as profit has entered into the equation , companies have become more proprietary with their models and less willing to share , " argued jessica(PERSON) kuntz(PERSON) , policy director at pitt(ORG) cyber(ORG) . this absence of transparency prevents algorithmic audits , making it difficult for journalists to build guardrails to protect against biases . 

if the genai space is left to develop unchallenged , as big tech currently stipulates , a future ai - rich world will find itself increasingly lacking a diversity of perspectives , such as those of women , ethnic minorities , publics from the global south and other cultures . 

luba(PERSON) kassova(PERSON) is the author of the missing perspectives of women in news report series , including the latest " from outrage to opportunity , " as well as articles in different outlets , including the guardian , foreign policy and euobserver . she is the co - founder and director of the international consultancy akas . luba(GPE) 's work has been quoted in news outlets in more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 75(CARDINAL) countries .

nicaragua(GPE) - files - icj - suit - on - germany - for - facilitating - the - commission - of - genocide - in -(GPE) gaza(GPE) : 

nicaragua(GPE) files icj suit on germany(GPE) for ‘ facilitating the commission of genocide ’ in gaza(GPE) 

the(GPE) hague(GPE) , mar(DATE) 1(DATE) ( efe).- nicaragua(GPE) filed a case against germany(GPE) at the international court of justice , accusing it of violating the genocide convention by providing financial and military aid to israel(GPE) and defunding the un(ORG) agency for palestinian(NORP) refugees ( unrwa(PERSON) ) , the un(ORG) ’s top court said friday(DATE) . 

“ germany(GPE) is facilitating the commission of genocide and , in any case has failed in its obligation to do everything possible to prevent the commission of genocide , ” nicaragua(GPE) said in its filing , according to the court ’s press release . 

nicaragua(GPE) asked the icj to issue emergency measures requiring berlin(GPE) to cease its military aid to israel(GPE) and reverse its decision to cut off funding to unrwa(PRODUCT) , arguing that this amounts to germany(GPE) ’s “ participation in the ongoing plausible genocide and serious breaches of international humanitarian law and other peremptory norms of general international law occurring in the(GPE) gaza(GPE) strip(GPE) . ” 

because germany(GPE) is a signatory to the 1948(DATE) genocide convention , the 1949(DATE) geneva conventions and their additional protocols , it has “ a duty ” to “ do everything possible to prevent the commission of genocide , ” nicaragua(GPE) said . 

but germany(GPE) has “ failed in its obligation ” and is instead “ facilitating the commission of genocide ” by providing political , financial and military support to israel(GPE) , while at the same time defunding unrwa(PRODUCT) at a time when there is “ a recognized risk of genocide against the palestinian(NORP) people , directed first(ORDINAL) of all against the population of the(GPE) gaza(GPE) strip(GPE) . ” 

in a separate case , south(GPE) africa(GPE) filed a case in late(DATE) december(DATE) accusing israel(GPE) of violating the genocide convention with its operations in gaza(GPE) , leading the icj to issue interim measures in january(DATE) requiring israel(GPE) to take “ immediate and effective ” steps to prevent the commission of genocide against palestinians(NORP) in gaza(GPE) . 

in late(DATE) january(DATE) , the israeli(NORP) defense forces accused 12(CARDINAL) unrwa(PRODUCT) workers of participating in the oct(DATE) .(DATE) 7(DATE) hamas(ORG) attacks that killed 1,139(CARDINAL) people and abducted 240(CARDINAL) , by participating in kidnappings and massacres of civilians . 

this prompted the un(ORG) to order an investigation into the agency and 18(CARDINAL) countries – including germany(GPE) , the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) , japan(GPE) and france- to announce the suspension of their contributions . efe

google cloud puts ai at centre of data analytics plans 

artificial intelligence will bridge the gap between structured and unstructured data , predicts google cloud ’s gerrit kazmaier(PERSON) 

artificial intelligence ( ai ) will play a growing role in unlocking the value in enterprise data , according to google cloud ’s lead executive for data analytics . 

gerrit(PERSON) kazmaier(PERSON) , vice - president and general manager for database , data analytics and looker at google cloud , told computer weekly(DATE) that the cloud and search giant ’s customers are already combining ai with more conventional business intelligence tools . 

this is because ai helps bring together structured and unstructured data , said kazmaier(PERSON) . ai systems are starting to perform increasingly complex analysis , but they can at much faster speeds and with much greater volumes of information than human experts . 

google(ORG) is supporting its customers in this by drawing on its background in search , as well as its cloud resources and its experience developing the transformer model , one of the foundations of generative ai systems . 

“ we are reimagining , let ’s call it , the google(PRODUCT) search for enterprise data , ” said kazmaier(PERSON) . much of this is about combining the potential of ai tools , including generative ai , trained largely on public data , with the domain and business specific information held in businesses ’ enterprise applications and data lakes . 

“ so far , google search is active mostly in the public domain or the public web , ” he said . “ there was ultimately a big opportunity of bringing this to the enterprise domain , basically giving every data point that exists in companies , which are not part of the worldwide web , a similar interface . 

“ everyone knows how to use google . every ceo on the planet , i ’m confident , knows how to use google to search the public web . i ’m equally confident that only a very small number of persons on this planet and certainly a small number of ceos would be able to use a dashboarding tool for themselves to find information about their own enterprise . 

“ with generative ai [ genai ] , we have the opportunity to talk to your enterprise data , as you can talk to public data via google(PRODUCT) search . ” 

google ‘ gets ’ data 

google(ORG) has a “ cultural understanding ” of the need to make information more accessible , according to kazmaier(PERSON) . this is at the heart of its mission to bring ai and conventional analytics together . 

“ from a technologist point of view , it starts with searching the world ’s information and making relevant information universally accessible and useful . that is required to build technology , which is heavily used today(DATE) in generative ai , ” he continued . 

“ there is a reason why google was the original inventor of the transformer model , which is now the underlying architecture of all of these models be it gemini [ formerly google(ORG) ’s bard ] , or chatgpt(ORG) , [ meta ’s ] llama and so on . 

“ there is a deep understanding first(ORDINAL) of all , when we say that we want to map someone ’s question to a meaningful answer , about the technology that we need to build to understand the semantics for processing that efficiently , and to give it back in a form factor a human can work with . ” 

google(ORG) has set out a roadmap to build ai into its analytics tools , integrating bigquery with vertex ai , enabling data to ai workflows in bigquery studio and allowing users to create machine learning models in bigquery(FAC) ml(FAC) and export them to vertex ai , as well as adding features to looker and looker studio . 

in google(ORG) ’s view , one(CARDINAL) of the applications for generative ai in the enterprise with the most promise is helping non - specialists interact with business data . 

rather than learning coding or analytics skills , or to write queries and design dashboards , genai should allow business users to interact with a database , data warehouse or data lake application using natural language – and to get a response in natural language too . 

this has two(CARDINAL) key advantages , aside from ease of use . 

it removes the need to filter data to match the format and capabilities of a dashboard . this inevitably means some information will be truncated or removed . and only a minority of enterprise users have the skills to drill down into the analytics tools themselves . 

an ai - based system has the potential to be more accurate as it can deal with larger data volumes , and a broader range of data sources . kazmaier(PERSON) referred to this as “ wide data ” . 

the other advantage is that users can interact with ai - driven systems in a more iterative way . they can fine tune and tweak queries , asking further questions until they find the information they need . 

kazmaier(PERSON) cites the example of camanchaca , a seafood firm in chile that is using a suite of standard bi tools , including bigquery , vertex ai and looker . it created an ai agent to give all employees access to the company ’s data . 

“ this unlocks data and analytics for the non - data analysis professional . everyone has a question to ask . not everyone has an analyst to answer that question , ” he said . 

“ there are these new use cases emerging for generative ai capabilities , which give us more than dashboarding and traditional data analytics . the consumer is changing , from the data analysts , now to every knowledge worker being given access to meaningful data analysis . ” 

this allows business intelligence to move from simply displaying data to interpreting information , in the way a human analyst would , according to kazmaier(PERSON) . 

“ when you look at data you want to have someone knowledgeable , like a professional analysis , to help you interpret that . what does that represent conceptually , or how does that compare ? ” he said . 

“ that ’s not a question that is necessarily answerable by the data point itself , but you need to someone really calibrated if you will , who understands how to interpret , ‘ is this a good or a bad margin ? is this a good or a bad , day(DATE) ’s sales outstanding ? ’ . 

“ this can be trained and encoded and is generated by the agents that we are introducing in our bi offering . so , basically , you are collaborating with an analyst that can help you to understand and to interpret the data that you ’ll see . one(CARDINAL) of the key problems that we have is traditional bi is that we have to compress information to a level that becomes human comprehensible . ” 

according to kazmaier(PERSON) , the consumers of data are changing . more users want access to data , and ai – especially generative ai – offers a way to open up that access in a way conventional bi can not . 

but there is more to the integration of ai into business intelligence , and into google(ORG) ’s roadmap , than simply providing a better interface . ai offers a way for firms to stay ahead of the seemingly endless growth of enterprise data – and hopefully drive some business value from it at the same time . 

kazmaier(PERSON) talks about “ wide ” rather than big data : not just having more data , but adding more data points to analysis . ai systems are well placed to decide if it is worth taking additional factors into account , he said , and they have the processing power to do this fast enough , as to not hold up decision making . 

“ one(CARDINAL) of the biggest changes that we have seen is the use of unstructured data , ” he said . “ if you think about it unstructured data , roughly , represents 90(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) of the world ’s data . traditionally , this data has not been used in data analytics . there were specialised applications for documents , or for automating certain processes like paying invoices , but it has not been considered a part of an enterprise data landscape that we actively use , explore and analyse , like you do with structured data . 

“ with generative ai , working with unstructured data , people understanding it and extracting information from it , becomes enormously flexible and available , ” he continued . 

and ai tools allow business users to dive deeper into the data and better understand the trends in their organisations : moving from “ what , when and where ” questions to , ultimately , “ why ” . 

“ you have large models being trained on public data , and you can ask them about public domain questions and it ’s amazing what it can do , ” kazmaier(PERSON) added . 

“ but these models are not being trained to use an enterprise ’s data , and that ’s quite interesting . how do we deploy these large [ language ] models with enterprise data so you can open up all of the insights that you have to your data , so all of them are of use in the company ? ” 

ai agents , he said , are already providing those answers .

turkey(GPE) has joined saudi(GPE) arabia(GPE) , egypt(GPE) and jordan(GPE) in condemning israeli(NORP) forces shooting desperately hungry palestinians(NORP) waiting for the delivery of aid , with the(ORG) turkish(ORG) foreign(ORG) ministry(ORG) accusing israel(GPE) of using “ starvation as a weapon of war in gaza(GPE) . ” 

at(CARDINAL) least(CARDINAL) 115(CARDINAL) palestinians(NORP) were killed and hundreds(CARDINAL) more wounded , the(ORG) health(ORG) ministry(ORG) in gaza(GPE) said . israeli(NORP) troops apparently fired heavily into the crowd , as(PERCENT) more(PERCENT) than(PERCENT) 80(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) of the wounded brought to one(CARDINAL) hospital had been struck by gunfire , the hospital 's chief said friday(DATE) . 

israel(GPE) said many of the dead were trampled in a chaotic crush for the food aid , and that its troops only fired when they felt endangered by the crowd . 

the number of palestinians(NORP) killed in the(GPE) gaza(GPE) strip(GPE) has soared above 30,000(CARDINAL) since israel(GPE) 's war on hamas(ORG) began nearly(DATE) five(DATE) months(DATE) ago(DATE) after hamas(ORG) - led militants stormed across southern israel(GPE) on oct(DATE) .(DATE) 7(DATE) , killing 1,200(CARDINAL) people and taking about(CARDINAL) 250(CARDINAL) others hostage . 

israel(GPE) responded with a blistering offensive in the(GPE) gaza(GPE) strip(GPE) that has created a humanitarian catastrophe and devastation in northern areas like gaza(GPE) city(GPE) , which are largely cut off from the rest of the territory with little aid entering .

washington(GPE) — president joe(PERSON) biden(PERSON) said friday(DATE) that the u.s(GPE) .(GPE) will begin air - dropping humanitarian assistance into gaza(GPE) , a(DATE) day(DATE) after witnesses say israeli(NORP) troops killed dozens(CARDINAL) of palestinians(NORP) as crowds raced to pull goods off an aid convoy . 

biden(PERSON) said the air drops will begin in the(DATE) “(DATE) coming(DATE) days(DATE) , ” and made the announcement while hosting italian(NORP) prime minister giorgia(PERSON) meloni(PERSON) at the(ORG) white(ORG) house(ORG) . 

at(CARDINAL) least(CARDINAL) 115(CARDINAL) palestinians(NORP) were killed on thursday(DATE) and more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 750(CARDINAL) others were injured , according to gaza(GPE) ’s health ministry . 

israel(GPE) said many of the dead were trampled in a stampede linked to the chaos and that its troops fired at some in the crowd who they believed moved toward them in a threatening way . 

palestinian(NORP) rivals hamas(ORG) and fatah(ORG) meet in moscow(GPE) , first(ORDINAL) meeting since oct(DATE) .(DATE) 7(DATE) 

beirut(GPE) — representatives of rival palestinian(NORP) groups hamas(ORG) and fatah(ORG) met in an official capacity for the first(ORDINAL) time since oct(DATE) .(DATE) 7(DATE) this(DATE) week(DATE) at a summit hosted by russia(GPE) , along with other palestinian(NORP) factions . 

following two(DATE) days(DATE) of meetings , the factions said in a joint statement friday(DATE) that they aim to hold more rounds of meetings to reach “ national unity that includes all palestinian(NORP) forces and factions within the framework of the(ORG) palestine(ORG) liberation(ORG) organization(ORG) , the sole legitimate representative of the palestinian(NORP) people . ” 

hamas(ORG) is not part of the fatah(ORG) - dominated plo(ORG) , which has officially recognized the state of israel(GPE) . hamas(ORG) does not — although its leaders have signaled that they are interested in joining the plo(ORG) , which would at least implicitly entail recognizing israel(GPE) based upon pre-1967(DATE) borders . 

hamas(ORG) political official osama(PERSON) hamdan(PERSON) said last(DATE) week(DATE) that his group hopes to reach a “ unified position ” on future governance of the palestinian(NORP) territories with fatah(ORG) and other factions . hamdan(PERSON) said hamas(ORG) supports a “ palestinian(NORP) government to be formed by the factions ” which would be tasked with post - war reconstruction and preparing for general elections in gaza(GPE) and the israeli(NORP) - occupied west(GPE) bank(GPE) . 

the form post - war governance of gaza(GPE) will take has been a matter of heated debate , including between israel(GPE) and its primary backer , the(GPE) united(GPE) states(GPE) . while both israel(GPE) and the u.s(GPE) .(GPE) say hamas(ORG) can not govern the enclave after the war , the biden administration seeks eventual palestinian(NORP) governance in gaza(GPE) and the israeli(NORP) - occupied west(GPE) bank(GPE) as a precursor to palestinian(NORP) statehood . the government of israeli(NORP) prime minister benjamin(PERSON) netanyahu(PERSON) rejects a two(CARDINAL) - state solution and envisions hand - picked palestinians(NORP) administering gaza(GPE) . 

egypt(GPE) 's foreign minister says he hopes for pause in gaza(GPE) fighting 

antalya , turkey(GPE) — egyptian(NORP) foreign minister sameh shoukri expressed hope for an agreement to pause fighting in gaza(GPE) that could lead to a permanent cease - fire . 

speaking at a diplomacy forum in the turkish(NORP) city of antalya(GPE) , shoukri said it was important that a cease - fire is achieved before the muslim(NORP) holy month of ramadan , which is expected to begin around(DATE) march(DATE) 10(DATE) . 

“ we are hopeful that the areas of divergence between the two(CARDINAL) sides can be bridged and that we can reach at least a temporary cessation of hostilities to lead to a permanent one , ” shoukri said . 

“ if this conflict was to continue in ramadan(DATE) , ” egypt(GPE) 's top diplomat added , “ i think this will have a very dire consequence in that the emotions will be further inflamed , the dissatisfaction of the arab(NORP) and muslim(NORP) world — not to mention , of course , the(GPE) west(GPE) bank(GPE) and jerusalem(GPE) — will be aggravated . ” 

speaking at the same panel , palestinian(NORP) foreign affairs minister riad(PERSON) malki(PERSON) accused israeli(NORP) prime minister benjamin(PERSON) netanyahu(PERSON) of harboring “ undeclared objectives ” of depopulating gaza(GPE) . 

“ this is exactly what netanyahu(PERSON) wants : to displace people completely out of gaza(GPE) , to not only to leave gaza(GPE) uninhabitable , but also to leave gaza(GPE) with no population , ” he said . 

malki is a cabinet member in the(ORG) palestinian(ORG) authority(ORG) , which administers semi - autonomous areas of the israeli(NORP) - occupied west(GPE) bank(GPE) . 

gaza(ORG) hospital(ORG) says 80(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) of its patients wounded in melee had been hit by gunfire 

deir(PERSON) al(PERSON) -(PERSON) balah(PERSON) , gaza(GPE) strip(GPE) — the head of a gaza(GPE) city(GPE) hospital where some of the wounded from a deadly melee over an aid convoy had been taken said friday(DATE) that more(PERCENT) than(PERCENT) 80(PERCENT) %(PERCENT) had been hit by gunfire . 

the remainder of the patients — 34(CARDINAL) of 176(CARDINAL) — were injured in a stampede triggered by the shooting , said dr(PERSON) .(PERSON) mohammed(PERSON) salha(PERSON) , acting director of the al(ORG) -(ORG) awda(ORG) hospital(ORG) . 

at(CARDINAL) least(CARDINAL) 112(CARDINAL) palestinians(NORP) were killed and more(CARDINAL) than(CARDINAL) 750(CARDINAL) were wounded after huge crowds of desperate people raced to pull goods off an aid convoy thursday(DATE) , according to health officials . 

witnesses said they came under fire from nearby israeli(NORP) troops . israel(GPE) said many of the dead were trampled in a stampede linked to the chaos and that its troops only fired when they felt endangered by the crowd . 

the high ratio of gunshot injuries among the wounded at al(ORG) -(ORG) awda(ORG) hospital(ORG) suggests there had been heavy israeli(NORP) fire . 

it was not immediately clear how many of the 112(CARDINAL) dead had been killed by gunfire . 

salha(ORG) said doctors at his hospital have been unable to operate on 20(CARDINAL) seriously wounded patients from thursday(DATE) ’s incident because of the lack of medicine , medical equipment and diesel for generators . 

the hospital , like others in gaza(GPE) , has been suffering severe shortages since israel(GPE) declared war following hamas ’ deadly oct(DATE) .(DATE) 7(DATE) attack and unleashed a blistering air and ground offensive across the besieged enclave .
