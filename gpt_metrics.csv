Monitoring can help in early detection and intervention to prevent widespread outbreaks and potential declines in frog populations.",0.2636392607493081,0.17738803811290363,0.24896847960960028,0.2606724199701822,0.15421535027467476,0.27735192161463224,0.17828081317695987,0.047650557022271785,0.23589430326289282,0.1088025116243776,0.04315155411573779,0.2814170336202129,0.49166666666666664,0.5476190476190477,0.5631067961165048,0.3025210084033613,0.24096385542168675,0.28431372549019607,0.35833333333333334,0.3333333333333333,0.36893203883495146,0.6941176470588235,0.5411764705882353,0.6823529411764706,0.42857142857142855,0.23809523809523808,0.34523809523809523,0.5058823529411764,0.32941176470588235,0.4470588235294118,0.5756097560975609,0.544378698224852,0.6170212765957447,0.35467980295566504,0.2395209580838323,0.3118279569892473,0.4195121951219512,0.33136094674556216,0.40425531914893614,0.6438356164383562,0.5285714285714286,0.6344086021505376,0.3472222222222222,0.2318840579710145,0.31521739130434784,0.3561643835616438,0.35714285714285715,0.41935483870967744,0.5529411764705883,0.43529411764705883,0.6941176470588235,0.2976190476190476,0.19047619047619047,0.34523809523809523,0.3058823529411765,0.29411764705882354,0.4588235294117647,0.5949367088607594,0.47741935483870973,0.6629213483146066,0.32051282051282054,0.20915032679738563,0.3295454545454546,0.32911392405063294,0.3225806451612903,0.43820224719101125,0.5176470588235295,0.6122448979591837,0.5370370370370371,0.2261904761904762,0.1875,0.2616822429906542,0.32941176470588235,0.3469387755102041,0.35185185185185186,0.5176470588235295,0.35294117647058826,0.6823529411764706,0.2261904761904762,0.10714285714285714,0.3333333333333333,0.32941176470588235,0.2,0.4470588235294118,0.5176470588235295,0.44776119402985076,0.601036269430052,0.2261904761904762,0.13636363636363635,0.2931937172774869,0.32941176470588235,0.2537313432835821,0.3937823834196892,0.3219178082191781,0.6530612244897959,0.6521739130434783,0.14482758620689656,0.1875,0.3076923076923077,0.19863013698630136,0.3673469387755102,0.42391304347826086,0.5529411764705883,0.3764705882352941,0.7058823529411765,0.25,0.10714285714285714,0.3333333333333333,0.3411764705882353,0.21176470588235294,0.4588235294117647,0.40692640692640697,0.4776119402985075,0.6779661016949153,0.18340611353711792,0.13636363636363635,0.32,0.2510822510822511,0.26865671641791045,0.44067796610169485,0.3651140281029328,0.37821445261335734,0.41350489659345907,0.437962962962963,0.348620729383223,0.49356972023389023,0.3612550667309647,0.3618063799156416,0.3965653939024066,0.202345082589605,0.4237552534928629,0.5141489313910788

These opponents believe that the measure may not effectively address the needs of individuals with mental health and substance use disorders and could potentially lead to mismanagement of funds and resources.",0.16335110226681004,0.24561127781870518,0.16130293545529747,0.15069048063156926,0.24936215315086066,0.186694934022753,0.17335205084967453,0.2577389138120567,0.15070869543639373,0.13551440080256563,0.21459349306505274,0.14292599351427965,0.39759036144578314,0.5,0.3761467889908257,0.18292682926829268,0.26153846153846155,0.2037037037037037,0.3132530120481928,0.3787878787878788,0.27522935779816515,0.5238095238095238,0.5238095238095238,0.6507936507936508,0.24193548387096775,0.27419354838709675,0.3548387096774194,0.4126984126984127,0.3968253968253968,0.47619047619047616,0.45205479452054803,0.5116279069767442,0.4767441860465116,0.20833333333333334,0.2677165354330709,0.2588235294117647,0.3561643835616438,0.38759689922480617,0.3488372093023256,0.35714285714285715,0.5,0.41304347826086957,0.1686746987951807,0.2923076923076923,0.23076923076923078,0.2976190476190476,0.3939393939393939,0.31521739130434784,0.47619047619047616,0.5238095238095238,0.6031746031746031,0.22580645161290322,0.3064516129032258,0.3387096774193548,0.3968253968253968,0.4126984126984127,0.4603174603174603,0.40816326530612246,0.5116279069767442,0.4903225806451613,0.19310344827586204,0.2992125984251969,0.27450980392156865,0.3401360544217687,0.40310077519379844,0.37419354838709673,0.42168674698795183,0.5740740740740741,0.375,0.2073170731707317,0.33962264150943394,0.18446601941747573,0.30120481927710846,0.46296296296296297,0.2692307692307692,0.5555555555555556,0.49206349206349204,0.6190476190476191,0.27419354838709675,0.2903225806451613,0.3064516129032258,0.3968253968253968,0.3968253968253968,0.4444444444444444,0.4794520547945206,0.5299145299145299,0.46706586826347307,0.2361111111111111,0.3130434782608696,0.23030303030303031,0.34246575342465757,0.42735042735042733,0.3353293413173653,0.3431372549019608,0.6521739130434783,0.36082474226804123,0.15841584158415842,0.3333333333333333,0.15625,0.2549019607843137,0.5217391304347826,0.25773195876288657,0.5555555555555556,0.47619047619047616,0.5555555555555556,0.25806451612903225,0.24193548387096775,0.24193548387096775,0.4126984126984127,0.38095238095238093,0.3968253968253968,0.42424242424242425,0.5504587155963303,0.4375,0.19631901840490798,0.28037383177570097,0.189873417721519,0.3151515151515151,0.4403669724770642,0.3125,0.29036406806489906,0.4134825327510917,0.302509399862897,0.26393248238822625,0.38295602891075237,0.3721408285052911,0.310041520979021,0.5010893246187365,0.3051615398580753,0.25202789537672804,0.5797724589313624,0.30243902439024384

"What does Sarah Williams suggest should be done with the UK's gas grid, and why? Answer in two lines",Sarah Williams suggests that the UK's gas grid should be remodelled to transport hydrogen to aid in the national net zero drive. As it would be Â£28 billion cheaper than decommissioning it.,Sarah Williams suggests that the UK's gas grid should be nationalized to prevent situations like the one where gas suppliers limited supply over a $1.2 billion debt. This would ensure more stable and reliable power generation in the country.,"Sarah Williams suggests that the UK's gas grid should be upgraded to prevent similar situations like the one where gas suppliers limited supply over a $1.2 billion debt, which led to a decrease in power generation.",Sarah Williams suggests that the UK's gas grid should be closely monitored and managed to prevent further disruptions in power generation due to suppliers limiting supply over a $1.2 billion debt. This is to ensure a stable and reliable energy supply for the country.,Sarah Williams suggests that the UK's gas grid should be expanded to increase supply and prevent future limitations due to debt issues. This expansion is necessary to ensure stable power generation in the country.,"Sarah Williams suggests that the UK's gas grid should be upgraded to prevent future supply issues, as the country's power generation is currently at its lowest level due to gas suppliers limiting supply over a $1.2 billion debt.", Sarah Williams suggests that the UK's gas grid should be improved to prevent a potential power supply crisis due to gas suppliers limiting supply over a $1.2 billion debt.," Sarah Williams suggests that the UK's gas grid should be upgraded to ensure reliable power supply, as the country's power generation is at its lowest level due to gas suppliers limiting supply over a $1.2 billion debt.", Sarah Williams suggests that the UK's gas grid should be improved to prevent a potential power supply crisis due to the decision by gas suppliers to limit supply over a $1.2 billion debt.,"Sarah Williams suggests that the UK's gas grid should be upgraded to ensure energy security and reduce dependence on external suppliers, especially in times of supply limitations due to debt issues.",Sarah Williams suggests that the UK's gas grid should be utilized more efficiently to ensure energy security and reduce dependence on external suppliers due to the recent supply limitations over a $1.2 billion debt.,Sarah Williams suggests that the UK's gas grid should be utilized more efficiently to ensure energy security and promote the use of natural gas as a prominent energy source for decades to come.,"I'm sorry, but there is no mention of Sarah Williams or the UK's gas grid in the provided context.",0.25354494478542816,0.2633959076918272,0.30475892956518574,0.25981003300837713,0.27331777379924194,0.3094285625931604,0.3045321159007903,0.22952177306405494,0.2919781303036754,0.30045004214040766,0.3035852934035207,0.12040298335559314,0.3902439024390244,0.4146341463414634,0.4375,0.25,0.275,0.3225806451612903,0.34146341463414637,0.34146341463414637,0.40625,0.48484848484848486,0.5151515151515151,0.42424242424242425,0.3125,0.34375,0.3125,0.42424242424242425,0.42424242424242425,0.3939393939393939,0.4324324324324324,0.4594594594594595,0.43076923076923074,0.2777777777777778,0.3055555555555556,0.3174603174603175,0.37837837837837834,0.37837837837837834,0.4,0.4,0.42105263157894735,0.4411764705882353,0.2564102564102564,0.2702702702702703,0.30303030303030304,0.35,0.3684210526315789,0.4117647058823529,0.48484848484848486,0.48484848484848486,0.45454545454545453,0.3125,0.3125,0.3125,0.42424242424242425,0.42424242424242425,0.42424242424242425,0.4383561643835617,0.4507042253521127,0.4477611940298507,0.28169014084507044,0.2898550724637681,0.3076923076923077,0.3835616438356164,0.3943661971830986,0.41791044776119407,0.45161290322580644,0.34782608695652173,0.4166666666666667,0.3333333333333333,0.2222222222222222,0.2857142857142857,0.45161290322580644,0.30434782608695654,0.4166666666666667,0.42424242424242425,0.48484848484848486,0.45454545454545453,0.3125,0.3125,0.3125,0.42424242424242425,0.42424242424242425,0.45454545454545453,0.4375,0.4050632911392405,0.43478260869565216,0.3225806451612903,0.25974025974025977,0.29850746268656714,0.4375,0.35443037974683544,0.43478260869565216,0.42857142857142855,0.42857142857142855,0.42857142857142855,0.29411764705882354,0.3235294117647059,0.3,0.42857142857142855,0.42857142857142855,0.42857142857142855,0.45454545454545453,0.45454545454545453,0.2727272727272727,0.3125,0.34375,0.1875,0.45454545454545453,0.45454545454545453,0.2727272727272727,0.4411764705882353,0.4411764705882353,0.33333333333333326,0.30303030303030304,0.33333333333333337,0.23076923076923075,0.4411764705882353,0.4411764705882353,0.33333333333333326,0.36334913112164297,0.392654028436019,0.4065167807103291,0.37126715092816787,0.4036958899828098,0.41646205357142857,0.4148727747678019,0.37719397106538466,0.4378855122611705,0.42534529787664693,0.44583082593651274,0.4
